It’s only fitting that this sunny online casino is based in Costa Rica and they have been operating flawlessly since 2002. </p><p>Sun Palace, like so many other online casinos, uses RealTime Gaming. These are great games, but the selection can be found at many other casinos in America. Players can expect around 200 games on offer including plenty of online. Sun Palace Casino Sun Palace Casino is an online casino also offering baccarat, blackjack, live dealer games, other games, roulette, scratch cards, and video poker using RTG software licensed in Panama.

Visit casino pobeda was launched in 2017 and is operated by direx n. Sun Palace Casino.</p><p>Any specific questions you may have that pertain to Sun Palace Casino will probably be answered by this review, since we plan on taking a very close look at every aspect of this veteran online gambling site and comparing them to other online casinos around the internet.</p><h2>Sun Palace Casino Reputation</h2><h2 id='sun-palace-online-casino'>Sun Palace Online Casino</h2><p>We did not find any information that suggests Sun Palace Casino has done anything in the past to ruin their reputation or to prove that they are unworthy of our trust. They are part of a very reputable group of casinos that is run by a company which certainly knows what they are doing when it comes to providing and high-quality and reliable product. However, it is fair to say that the fact they are licensed in Costa Rica is only slightly better than not having a license at all.</p><h2>Software Client at Sun Palace Casino</h2><p>The best way to access the games on Sun Palace Casino is to download their casino software to your computer. It is available by clicking on the “Download Casino” button at the top of their homepage. This download only takes a matter of seconds and it will give you access to every game in their library.</p><p>If you do not want to download their safe casino software you can still access the casino through their website using the Instant Play feature. This is available for both Mac and Windows computers. The only downside to using Instant Play is that many of the games in their library are not available, so it is better to just use the downloadable client.</p><h2>Slot Games at Sun Palace Casino</h2><p><strong>Slot Providers:</strong> Realtime Gaming<br><strong>Number of Slot Games:</strong> 171</p><p>Over 75% of the game library on Sun Palace Casino is comprised of slot games and over half of these games have progressive jackpots attached. These jackpots are both local and shared with the shared jackpots reaching up over 3 million dollars in some cases, which is truly insane. </p><p>In this section, you will also find 3-reel, 5-reel and 6-reel slots with exciting bonus rounds. This group of games usually has a higher house edge than other games do, but they will clear the playthrough requirements of your deposit bonuses faster.</p><h2>Table Games at Sun Palace Casino</h2><p><strong>Primary Table Games:</strong> Blackjack, Roulette, Caribbean Draw Poker, Caribbean Hold’Em, Caribbean Stud Poker, Baccarat, Pai Gow Poker, Red Dog Poker, Vegas Three Card Rummy, Tri Card Poker, Craps, War, Texas Hold’Em Bonus Poker, Let ‘Em Ride<br><strong>Primary Table Games Not Offered:</strong> Ultimate Texas Hold’Em</p><p>Even though there is only one variation of each game, it is tough to think of any games that Sun Palace Casino left out of their table game library. This selection includes most of the games that you will find in your local casino. Unfortunately, you are forbidden from participating in most of these games while you are clearing one of the various deposit bonuses offered by Sun Palace Casino. </p><p>Sun Palace Casino is yet another online gambling site that defies the usual pattern of only offering progressive jackpots for slot games. If you want to play table games with the opportunity of winning huge jackpots, then you can play Let‘Em Ride, Caribbean Hold’em, or Caribbean Stud Poker which all had massive progressive jackpots of over $100,000 at the time of our review.</p><h3>Blackjack at Sun Palace Casino</h3><p><strong>Types of Blackjack Offered:</strong> Classic Blackjack, Perfect Pairs Blackjack, European Blackjack, Match Play 21, Pontoon, Super 21, Suit ‘Em Up Blackjack</p><p>All of these blackjack games are listed under the “21 games” category of the table games tab. They are essentially just basic blackjack games with slight tweaks involved. You will be able to bet anywhere from $1 to $250 per hand in these games which is a huge advantage for the low rollers of the internet since brick and mortar casinos almost never allow $1 bets.</p><p>All of these games use a 6-deck shoe, with the exception of Pontoon, which only uses 2 decks. It seems as if this does not mean much since all of these games have a very small house edge ranging from 98.94% to 99.46%. Therefore, you should just try all of them out and then stick to the one that is the most fun for you since the house edge is relatively irrelevant.</p><h3>Roulette at Sun Palace Casino</h3><p><strong>Types of Roulette Offered:</strong> American Roulette, European Roulette, French Roulette, Multi-Player Roulette</p><p>Roulette players will have no shortage of options to enjoy on Sun Palace Casino since the three major variations are accounted for. There is also a multi-player variation which allows you to see other players’ bets on top of yours just like in a real casino. As usual, we recommend avoiding any variation other than European Roulette, since the house edge is 2.5% lower for this game due to the lack of a double zero spot on the wheel.</p><h2>Video Poker Games at Sun Palace Casino</h2><p><strong>Video Poker Games Offered:</strong> Aces &amp; Eights, All American Poker, Bonus Deuces Wild, Bonus Poker, Bonus Poker Deluxe, Deuces Wild, Double Bonus Poker, Double Double Bonus Poker, Double Double Jackpot Poker, Double Jackpot Poker, European Slot Poker, Jacks or Better, Mystery Bonus Poker, Loose Deuces, Joker Poker, Pick ‘Em Poker, Sevens Wild, 7 Stud Poker</p><p>Fans of popular digital video poker games should be happy to know that there are 18 different games in this category. This makes video poker the third largest category at Sun Palace Casino. The three games known as Pick ‘Em Poker, 7 Stud Poker, and European Slot Poker are the only ones which do not have multi-hand capabilities, while all of the other games will allow you to play up to 100 hands at once.</p><p>If you are looking for the video poker game with the highest return percentage so that your money lasts longer, than you will want to play in Aces &amp; Eights which has a 99.78% return percentage. Another option is Double Jackpot Poker, which has a 99.63% return percentage. You should also shy away from any of the multi-hand games if possible since the house edge increases for these games in exchange for the entertainment level getting cranked up a notch or two.</p><h2>Specialty Games at Sun Palace Casino</h2><p><strong>Specialty Games Offered:</strong> Bingo, Keno, Scratch Cards</p><p>If you don’t care much about the games you play having a slightly higher house edge in exchange for them being unique and non-traditional types of casino games, then this is the section for you. Apeaksoft data <a href='https://hereuload982.weebly.com/apeaksoft-data-recovery-1-0-12.html' title='recovery'>recovery</a> 1 0 12. In this category, you will find scratch cards that let you bet anywhere from $10 to $100 per card as well as one basic keno game and a few bingo variations. </p><p>An exciting aspect of the scratch card games is that many of them have a progressive jackpot. These jackpots are awarded randomly and they range anywhere from $2,000 to $3,000 at the time of our review. One of their bingo games also offers a jackpot for players who fill their entire card which was set at just over $10,000 at the time of this review.</p><h2>Live Dealer Games at Sun Palace Casino</h2><p><strong>Live Dealer Games:</strong> None</p><img src='https://cdn.casinosopentousa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/sunpalacecasino-lobby-min.png' alt='Online' title='Online'><p>Any social butterflies who like to chat with their dealers might want to find another online casino to play on since <strong>there are no Live Dealer games available on Sun Palace Casino</strong>. Luckily, there are a ton of other online casinos with live dealer games so you just have to shop around a little bit.</p><h2>Mobile Games at Sun Palace Casino</h2><p>There is <strong>no mobile app available for download</strong> on Sun Palace Casino but you can still access their game library from your mobile device through any standard web browser. Once you go to their website and log into your account you will have on-the-go access to all of the casino games that you can normally find in the instant play feature on your computer’s browser.</p><h2>Sign-Up Bonus at Sun Palace Casino</h2><p>There is a nice selection of <strong>3 different sign-up bonuses</strong> to choose from at Sun Palace Casino that feature perks such as bonus money and free spins. What makes their sign-up bonuses unique is that you can claim ALL of them instead of being forced to choose just one which is what will happen in most online casinos.</p><p>The first bonus of this list is a <strong>400% match deposit bonus for up to $10,000</strong> which requires you to deposit at least $20 using the bonus code “400BONUS”. You will only be able to play in slot games, scratch card games or keno games when clearing this bonus’s playthrough requirement which is set at 50 times the sum of the deposit amount plus the bonus amount.</p><p>The second bonus for new players on Sun Palace Casino is a <strong>150% match deposit bonus for up to $7,000</strong> using the bonus code “SLOTS200”. You will once again only be allowed to play in slot games, scratch card games, or keno games while clearing the playthrough requirement for this bonus which is set at 40 times the sum of the deposit amount plus the bonus amount. </p><p>Last, but also least, comes the third part of the sign-up package which features <strong>$20 in free bonus money</strong> using the coupon code 20FREECASH which can only be cleared by playing in slot games. You can also claim 20 free spins on the game Crystal Waters Slot using the bonus code “20FREESPINS”.</p><h2>Other Promotions at Sun Palace Casino</h2><p>There is certainly no shortage of bonus promotions to choose from on Sun Palace Casino which you can see for yourself in your account cashier under the “Coupons” tab. Every single promotion that you see on the list is easily redeemable by either clicking on the Redeem Coupon button or entering the bonus code, if necessary.</p><p>Almost all of these promotions are match deposit bonuses so they should definitely consider adding in some more variety here. However, we give them credit for their selection of match deposit bonuses since they seem to cover a wide range of players and it would be tough for someone to find one that does not apply to their preferences.</p><h3>Slot Tournaments</h3><p>As long as you are logged into Sun Palace Casino from the downloadable client for your PC then you will have access to the slots tournaments. However, it turns out that this lobby is a ghost town since there are 0 entrants in every tournament that has either been completed or is still registering.</p><h3>Football Frenzy Bonus</h3><p>In honor of soccer/football fans everywhere, Sun Palace Casino offers a 200% match deposit bonus for up to $2,000 using the bonus code “WORLDCUP2018”. You will also receive 10 free spins on the soccer-themed game called Football Frenzy. In order to clear this bonus, you will need to wager 30 times the sum of the deposit amount plus the bonus amount, which makes it one of the easiest bonuses to clear on the entire site!</p><h3>American Express Bonus</h3><p>Anyone who plans on depositing with an American Express card will be pleased to know that there is a 200% match deposit bonus up for grabs with a maximum bonus of $2,000 if you make an American Express deposit of at least $20 using the bonus code “AMEX200”. You will then need to wager 40 times the sum of the deposit amount plus the bonus amount before you can withdraw any funds.</p><h3>Slots Bonus</h3><p>This slots-focused bonus is the same as the one on Slots Plus casino which can only be cleared by playing in slot games, keno games, scratch cards, or bingo games. As long as you deposit at least $20 you will receive a 200% match deposit bonus using the bonus code “HOTSLOTS”. Just in case that wasn’t enough, they also added in a second way to win a prize with this promotion since if you lose your deposit you can simply contact the Live Chat customer support team and they will put an extra $50 bonus into your account.</p><h3>Blackjack Bonus</h3><p>It makes sense for an online casino to include a deposit bonus for those who love one of the most popular casino games in the world and this promotion features a 100% match bonus for up $500. In order to qualify for this bonus, you will need to deposit at least $50 using the bonus code “BJMATCH” and the maximum cashout is set at $2,000. </p><p>The playthrough requirements are a little tougher than usual for this promotion due to the low house edge since you will need to wager 80x the sum of the deposit amount plus the bonus amount before you can withdraw any funds.</p><h2 id='sun-palace-casino-coupon-codes'>Sun Palace Casino Coupon Codes</h2><h3>250% Bonus</h3><p>This impressive promotion offers a 250% match deposit bonus for up to $2,500 and since there is no bonus code associated with this bonus you will simply need to redeem the corresponding coupon located in your account cashier under the tab “Coupons”. You will need to wager 40x the sum of the deposit amount plus the bonus amount before you can withdraw, which is pretty difficult considering the fact that the bonus is 250%. </p><p>For example, if you deposit $100 and receive $250 in bonus funds you will need to clear 40 times the amount of $350 which means you will need to wager $14,000 before you can withdraw anything from a $100 deposit.</p><h3>$2,000 Bonus</h3><p>This hefty deposit bonus allows you to claim a 200% bonus for up to $2,000 as long as you redeem the bonus coupon before you make your deposit. There does not appear to be any bonus code associated with this bonus so in order to redeem it you will need to go into your account cashier and click on the green “Redeem” button next to the promotion titled “20% to play our Best Games!” which is near the bottom of the long list. </p><p>You will need to wager 40x the sum of your deposit plus the bonus amount before you can withdraw any funds unless you are playing in video poker games which will cause this playthrough requirement to increase to 60x.</p><h3>Sun Palace Casino Loyalty Program</h3><p>Much like their sister casinos, Sun Palace Casino offers some sweet perks for their frequent players which come mainly in the form of comp points. Every time you make a bet in the any of the games on this site you will be rewarded with comp points that can be traded in at the rate of 100 comp points per dollar. </p><p>As you earn these comp points you will travel from the Bronze Tier through the Silver, Gold, Platinum and Diamond tiers which will increase your rewards gradually with each step. The best part about moving up in status is the fact that the wager that is required to earn a comp point will improve from $15 per point all the way down to $8.</p><h2 id='sun-palace-casino-usa'>Sun Palace Casino Usa</h2><h2>Bonus Terms and Conditions at Sun Palace Casino</h2><p>It is important to remember that bonus money on Sun Palace Casino is not available for withdrawal and you will only be able to cash out your winnings that come from gambling with that bonus money. You will only be able to complete these withdrawals after you have completed the playthrough requirements which vary from promotion to promotion. </p><p>If you are playing in video poker games then your playthrough requirements will be much tougher to complete than if you are playing in any other accepted game. Any wagers that you make while you have an active bonus can NOT be made on blackjack games, craps, Vegas three card rummy, tri card poker, Caribbean draw poker, Caribbean hold’em, Caribbean stud poker, baccarat, roulette, sicbo or progressive jackpot games. This is an extremely long list of forbidden games and if you happen to play any of them while you are trying to clear a bonus then any winnings that are derived from these rounds will be confiscated when you go to withdraw funds. </p><p>One of the strange clauses located in the bonus terms and conditions page is that all European players will be required to clear a playthrough requirement that is double the number that is advertised. For example, if the sign-up bonus requires players to wager 40x the sum of the deposit amount plus the bonus amount so players from Europe will need to wager 80x the sum of the deposit amount plus the bonus amount.</p><h2>Customer Support at Sun Palace Casino</h2><p><strong>Customer Support Options:</strong> Email, Live Chat</p><p>Anytime you have some questions about Sun Palace Casino or a problem with your account you can reach them either by email or by using Live Chat. There is no phone number available here like most casinos have, but that shouldn’t matter much if the Live Chat feature functions smoothly.</p><p>Speaking of the Live Chat feature, all you need to do in order to use it is click on the purple “Chat Now” button in the lower right-hand corner of their website. We gave this feature a test run and once we filled in our personal information we were talking with a human representative in 2 seconds which is insanely quick. However, it is a fair warning that their English seems fairly broken and they had a hard time understanding even the most basic of our questions. </p><p>The second option you have to contact customer support is to send an email to support@sunpalacecasino.eu and wait for a response. With the Live Chat feature being so effective, there is really no reason to use the email support method unless you are sending in your identity verification documents. We sent a test email just to see how fast the response time is for this method and we were greeted by a response in 18 minutes which is extremely fast for an email response.</p><h2>Deposit and Withdrawals at Sun Palace Casino</h2><p><strong>Minimum Deposit:</strong> $5<br><strong>Maximum Deposit:</strong> $5,000<br><strong>Deposit Methods:</strong> Bitcoin, Visa Card, Mastercard, American Express, MST Gift Card, Wire Transfers, Neteller, Paysafecard, QIWI, Safety Pay, Yandex<br><strong>Withdrawal Methods:</strong> Direct Payout via ACH, Check by Courier, Check by Mail, Neteller</p><p>If you like the information you have gathered about Sun Palace Casino thus far and you are ready to make a deposit then you have eleven banking options to choose from. The first six methods on the list above are available for U.S. players and all of these options will be completed instantly upon your deposit request. </p><p>The minimum deposit limits from banking option to banking option are not that much different since they seem to range from $5 with an MST Card to $25 with a credit or debit card. However, the maximum deposit limits range pretty widely since you can only deposit $200 using Paysafecard, QIWI, SafetyPay, or Yandex while the almighty Bitcoin will allow you to deposit up to $5,000 at once. </p><p>As far as withdrawing money off of Sun Palace Casino goes, there are four different banking options for players to take advantage of. Three of these four withdrawal methods are available for players in the U.S., Canada, UK, Brazil, and Australia while players from other countries have the additional option of withdrawing their funds using Neteller. </p><p>The minimum amount that you can withdraw from Sun Palace Casino at one time is $150 unless you are using the Check by Courier withdrawal method which comes with a $400 minimum limit. We feel that this number might be a little steep and unfair to low rollers considering the fact that the minimum deposit limit is so small. </p><p>The maximum amount that you can withdraw from Sun Palace Casino varies wildly since a Check by Mail will limit you to $399 while a Neteller withdrawal will allow the player to take out up to $5,000 at once. Players from the U.S. should probably use the Direct Payout via ACH or Check by Courier methods if they wish to withdraw the most money possible since the limit on both of these methods is set at $2,500. The strange part is that their banking terms and conditions state that the maximum withdrawal is set at $2,000 per week unless you have a high VIP status.</p><p>There are no fees associated with any deposit options on Sun Palace Casino which is always a great thing to see as an online gambler. This is surprising since half of their withdrawal options are checks which usually come with hefty fees attached to them. </p><p>Castle maker <a href='https://downqload744.weebly.com/castle-maker-game.html'>game</a>. It appears that the speed of the withdrawals on Sun Palace Casino is a tad bit slower than other online casinos since they say flat out in their terms and conditions that we should expect withdrawals to take two weeks to process. No deposit bonus <a href='https://mjpcjslots-owlno-deposit-bonus-mobile-casinos.peatix.com' title='mobile'>mobile</a> casinos. To be on the safe side, you should avoid the check options if you are trying to get your money as fast as possible because these are always the slowest options in our experience.</p><div><h3>Related Posts:</h3></div>If you wish to test the games at Sun Palace Casino, you can use the Instant Play Feature.
