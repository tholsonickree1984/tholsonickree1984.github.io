you’re not familiar with Video Poker, this is a great game for all different playing levels. Whether you’re an expert or just a beginner, this game caters to all crowds. Also, if you enjoy playing slot machines this is a <strong>great alternative</strong>. Video poker on the other hand involves more <strong>skills </strong>than luck when trying to win. Another great thing about the game is that you can figure out right away what the <strong>payback percentage</strong> is by simply reviewing the paytable.</p><p>If it is an online video poker game, they will choose a coin by clicking on the screen of the game. After they place the wager, they will click on a button that says “Deal.” They will then get a poker hand that consists of 5 cards. Not make the most basic video poker mistakes; Video poker is a great casino game top play if you know what you’re doing. If you’re already familiar with most of the strategies and ways to beat video poker.</p><p>Video Poker is also similar to the traditional <strong>five card poker game</strong>, except for the that fact that you have no other players to compete against, and that you don’t have to worry about losing more than your initial bet. The goal is pretty much the same, you need to try and get the <strong>strongest hand possible</strong> with the five cards you’ve been dealt, however for each hand you have the opportunity to discard up to five cards from the initial hand you’ve been dealt. <strong>The better your hand is, the higher your payout will be.</strong></p><p>In this article, we’ll be reviewing a few different variations of the game as well as some ways on <strong>how to beat Video Poker</strong>.</p><h2>Video Poker Machines</h2><p>Since there are <strong>many different versions</strong> of Video Poker, it’s a good idea to play just one or two different types of games. This is because each one has <strong>different strategies</strong>, therefore it can be hard to remember all of them. If you’re tired of playing one game, go ahead and move on to another one you’re familiar with, but again, learn no more than two strategies at a time as it can get confusing trying to learn all of them at once. Before we go over some strategies for <strong>Video Poker machines</strong>, let’s go ahead and discuss a couple different versions you can find at the land based casinos and online.</p><p><strong>Deuces Wild</strong></p><p>Is a very <strong>popular variation of Video Poker</strong>. Like the classic five card game of poker, the objective is to get the best poker hand possible by using a standard 52 deck of cards with the help of some wild cards, which for this version are the deuces. That means the <strong>deuces are the strongest cards</strong> you can get, and they can act like any type of card, therefore you should never discard them. For example, if you have three fives and a deuce, this will automatically change the value of your hand to having four fives (four of a kind).</p><p><strong>Jacks or Better</strong></p><p>Also known as <strong>Draw Poker</strong>, is the<strong> oldest version</strong> of Video Poker and allows you to play up to <strong>100 hands at a time</strong>. The more hands you choose to bet with, the greater your potential winnings can be. On top of that, you can get an extra point for each pair of Jacks or higher you receive.</p><h2>Video Poker Tips</h2><p>Learning some <strong>Video Poker tips</strong> can help you <strong>become a better player</strong> and save you a lot of money in the long run. Sure you can win by simply guessing, however your chances are greater if you understand all the rules and learn some strategies. That way you’ll know what to do for every hand you’ve been dealt. It’s also a good idea to play just <strong>one or two different types of versions at a time</strong> as each one has different strategies making it difficult to be able to remember them all. In that case, below are some <strong>basic strategies</strong> you can use while playing Deuces Wild.</p><p>Once you have gone over all the rules to the game, the first thing you want to remember is to <strong>never discard any of the deuces</strong> you might receive. Believe it or not, this tip can be easily forgotten as for most card games, the deuces are usually the lowest valued card. Another thing to remember is to <strong>play each hand as if you’re trying to get a Royal Flush</strong>. For example, if you receive three cards that begin a Royal Flush, go ahead and discard the other two so that you have a chance to get this poker hand. If you’re ever dealt two deuces, two cards lower than 10 and another one worth more than 10, go ahead and get rid of the ones cards that are worth less than 10. If you’re dealt five cards that are useless, go ahead and request five new cards.</p><p>Another thing you need to understand is that there are <strong>32 different possibilities</strong> on how you can play each hand. If you were to break down all the various possibilities, here’s what it would look like below.</p><ul><li>Keeping all the initial cards you’ve received, therefore not discarding any of them.</li><li>Or vice versa, you can discard all five of them by replacing them with new ones.</li><li>Discard four cards and keep just one. This possibility can be done from five different angles depending on the ones you decide to keep as well as the ones you get rid of.</li><li>Or you can do the opposite, and discard all four of them instead, while keeping just one.</li></ul><p>By now you should have a good understanding of the <strong>two popular versions of Video Poker</strong> as well as some basic strategies that you can use for Deuces Wild. In fact, you can start playing this game now here at <strong>Caesars Casino online</strong> for free. That’s right. You can enjoy this game as well as Jacks or better <strong>without risking any of your hard earned money</strong>. It’s also a great way to <strong>practice the strategies</strong> we gave you as well as any other ones you may want to try out. If you’ve never played our games before, you’re in luck because we have a<strong> special welcome gift</strong> for you as soon as you start!</p><div><h3>Related posts:</h3></div><h2>Video poker casinos</h2><p>Our experts have recommended the following casinos for top-notch video poker.</p><div>Very Good</div><ul><li>Transparent about responsible gambling and fair pay-outs.</li><li>Excellent slot game catalogue.</li><li>Intuitive user interface and great user experience overall.</li></ul>Casino review<ul><li>100% up to £200</li><li>+ 11 Bonus Spins</li></ul><div> 18+.

It’s a single player game, where the player tries to create as valuable a poker hand as possible. If they create a hand above a certain value (usually a pair of jacks) they win cash. If they don’t, they lose their stake.</p><p>For each round, the player is dealt five cards face up via a video screen. They must then choose whether to hold any of their cards for the ‘draw’. They can hold any number from zero to five. All cards that are not held are then re-dealt, and the final hand evaluated.</p><p>Winning hands can often be gambled via a ‘higher or lower’ game. UK players will be familiar with this concept as it was used in the popular 70s/80s quiz show ‘Play Your Cards Right’. A single card is dealt and the player must guess if the next card in sequence will be higher or lower. If they choose correctly, their prize is doubled. Choose incorrectly, and all winnings for that hand are lost. Players can usually gamble in this way up to five times in succession.</p><h2>The history of video poker</h2><p>The first video poker games arrived at the same time as ‘Pong’ and early, primitive personal computers. Video monitors were hooked up to integrated circuits in which the game was programmed. Early video poker consoles were dismissed as a passing fad.</p><p>All this changed in the early 1980s when SIRCOMA, the company that would eventually become International Game Technology, decided to concentrate on perfecting the video poker console. This turned out to be a Vegas-shattering success, as it gave poker players who felt intimidated while playing on casino tables the chance to play their favourite pastime against a faceless ‘opponent’.</p><p>The popularity of video poker has yet to wane. While not too popular with Las Vegas visitors, the locals tend to enjoy playing video poker machines off the main Vegas strip. Nearly all real-world casinos will house a few video poker terminals under their roof.</p><p>Despite massive strides in computer technology and in particular video graphics, contemporary video poker machines are little different from their primitive forebears. Video poker fans are keen that their game is kept as ‘traditional’ as possible, and video poker has not developed in the same way that online slots games have evolved to be feature-rich monsters.</p><h2>Video poker at online casinos</h2><p>Nearly every single online casino will offer at least one variety of video poker, and most will offer several. While not as popular as slots, blackjack or roulette, video poker is a rarity as with correct play and taking in all factors, the house edge can be swung ever-so-slightly in favour of the player.</p><p>There are four main varieties of video poker:</p><ul><li>JACKS OR BETTER – This is the main version of the game. To secure a win, a player must end up with a hand that contains at least a pair of jacks. All other hands lose. Payouts start at x1 for any qualifying pair, up to x800 for a Royal Flush.</li><li>ALL AMERICAN – Similar to Jacks or Better and with the same basic rules, but with a better payout structure. There are increased payouts for flushes, straights and straight flushes, but reduced payouts for full houses and two pairs.</li><li>DEUCES WILD – The lowest winning hand in this game is a set, but as the name suggests, all deuces (twos) are wild. There are additional winning hands, such as Five of a Kind, Wild Royal Flush and Four Deuces. The five-credit version of this game with the correct pay table actually has a negative house edge when played with perfect strategy.</li><li>JOKER POKER – Also know as ‘Joker’s Wild’, is played with a deck containing 53 cards in which one of them is a joker and can be used as any card when drawn. The lowest possible winning hand is a pair of kings, and Five of a Kind and a Wild Royal Flush are added to the the mix just as with Deuces Wild. Again, if the pay table is set correctly, the player actually has a 0.64 percent edge over the house with perfect strategy. There are also self-explanatory sub-variations of Joker Poker known as Kings or Better, or Two Pairs or Better.</li></ul><p>Multi-hand video poker games have become popular at online casinos in recent years. This allows you to play up to 100 hands at one from the draw. If, for example, you hold two aces before the draw and play 100 hands, you can play all 100 hands with two aces and three newly drawn cards. This is very beneficial if you are dealt a winning hand before the draw.</p><p>Other less common varieties of video poker are as follows:</p><ul><li>ACES AND FACES – A standard game with increased payouts for four of a kind of any face card or an ace. Payouts for other hands such as a full house are reduced.</li><li>ALL ACES or BONUS POKER – Same as Jacks or Better but with increased payouts for four aces, deuces, threes or fours, and reduced payouts for other hands.</li><li>BONUS FLUSH – Jacks or Better but with increased payouts for flushes.</li><li>DEUCES AND JOKER – A combination of Deuces Wild and Joker Poker or Joker’s Wild.</li><li>DOUBLE BONUS – Same as Bonus Poker but with a different payout structure.</li><li>DOUBLE DOUBLE BONUS – As above, but with other bonus hands such as four aces with a two, three or four kicker.</li><li>DOUBLE JOKER – Same as Joker Poker or Joker’s Wild but with two jokers instead of one.</li><li>PICK’EM POKER – Players are dealt four cards. They must keep the first two, and MUST discard either (not both) of the next two. After the decision has been made, the final two cards are dealt to complete the hand.</li><li>TENS OR BETTER – A pair of tens is the lowest winning hand. There are reduced payouts for flushes and full houses.</li></ul><h2>Learn how to play video poker</h2><p>Learn how to play online video poker with RightCasino’s online guide.</p><p>Online video poker was introduced to casinos in the 1970s as a single-player equivalent to table poker. At the time, it was a bit of a technological marvel and quickly became popular. Today, the game is still played widely for its simple rules, low house edge and the possibility of big wins. Our step-by-step guide will steer you through the rules and variants of video poker so you can get the most out of this exciting casino game.</p><h2>How to play</h2><p><a href='https://trueeload884.weebly.com/slots-of-vegas-casino-no-deposit-bonus.html'>Slots of vegas casino no deposit bonus</a>. The rules of video poker are extremely straightforward…</p><h4>Pick your coins</h4><p>In most versions of video poker, you will use an electronic interface to bet on a virtually-generated straight poker hand. You begin by making a wager of up to five ‘coins’ (the value of which depend on the game and chosen settings). <a href='https://truepup133.weebly.com/blog/show-me-how-to-play-blackjack' title='Show me how to play blackjack'>Show me how to play blackjack</a>. The more money you are happy to wager, the more you can win. Usually, your winnings are simply multiplied by the amount of cash you gamble, although you may receive a bonus lift if you go the whole hog with five coins.</p><h4>Generating your hand</h4><h2 id='how-to-win-at-video-poker'>How To Win At Video Poker</h2><p>Once your stake has been set, the game will generate a hand of five cards based on a digital, 52-card deck (up to 53 in ‘Joker Wild’ games). This is your starting hand. In some games you can play 5, 10, 25 or even 100 hundred hands all at the same time. Each hand will begin with your ‘main’ hand as the base.</p><h4>Choosing discards</h4><p>Once your starting hand has been generated, you can choose which of your cards to discard. The discards are then replaced with new cards from the remaining deck.</p><h4>Collect your winnings!</h4><p>You are then paid on the value of your hand according to a paytable. Usually for a qualifying pair, you receive back the same amount of money you gambled. Payouts go up as far as a royal flush, for which you typically receive back 250x your stake.</p><h4>Darest you gamble?</h4><p>You can usually gamble your winnings when you hit a successful hand at video poker. If you do decide to gamble, you’ll be presented with a card, and you have to guess whether the next card drawn will be higher or lower. If you pick right, your prize is doubled. <a href='https://coolqfile888.weebly.com/1password-3-8-20-powerful-password-manager.html' title='1password 3 8 20 – powerful password manager'>1password 3 8 20 – powerful password manager</a>. If you choose unwisely, then you lose everything. Depending on the game, you should be able to go ‘double or quits’ up to five times in succession.</p><h2>Video poker variations</h2><p>Find the best house edge with our list of popular video poker variations.</p><p>There are several different versions of video poker, all of which come with extremely favourable odds for the player (even positive expectation by some estimates). See which variants present the best edge with our overview of video poker variants (along with pay-tables). All pay-outs are calculated according to betting five credits and assume ‘optimal’ play.</p><h2>Jacks or Better</h2><p>Also known as 9/6 Jacks or Better.

Low pay machines offer a lower return (8/5, where full houses and flushes return eight and five times your bet respectively are most common). This results in a higher house edge.</p><p>If possible, you should always aim for full paying machines with a better return. Any game with a lower return than those in the tables above would be considered ‘low-pay’.

Video poker is an extremely popular game that is enjoyed across the globe by millions of players, many of whom choose to play via a smart device.</p><h2>What is mobile video poker?</h2><p>By recent estimates, around $10 billion is wagered through mobile platforms every singly year, and mobile revenues are increasing all the time.</p><p>Video poker on mobile devices is identical to the game you would expect on desktops: the interface is the same, as are the rules of play. The only difference is that you can gamble literally anywhere, as long as you have a compatible device and a robust internet connection.</p><h2>Video poker on mobile devices</h2><p>As video poker is a relatively simple game to port to mobile platforms, it’s genuinely surprising that more software providers do not provide versions of video poker for mobile devices. The reason for this could be due to the ban on US-based players from the mobile casino arena, and that video poker is still seen as an activity suited to US casinos.</p><p>There are a few mobile casinos that do offer a version of video poker on mobile devices – 32Red, for example.</p><p>Most casinos that offer video poker requires a download in order for players to be able to play the game. These downloads are only typically available for Android and iOS based systems. As more and more mobile software providers begin to embrace HTML5 as the mobile-coding ‘option of choice’, more games will be available for Windows Phone and BlackBerry users.</p><h2>How to player video poker on a mobile device</h2><h2 id='play-video-poker'>Play Video Poker</h2><p>Playing video poker on a mobile devices is as simple an affair as playing video poker at any online casino.</p><p>Unfortunately, only the most basic version of video poker – Jacks or Better – seems to be available for mobile platforms.</p><p>You begin the game by selecting the size of your bet, using from one to five coins.
