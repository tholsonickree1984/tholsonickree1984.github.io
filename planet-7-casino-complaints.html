This means that the Casino is primarily for entertainment value, and no deposit is necessary or required to play the Casino. While you may play the Planet 7 Casino games without betting money, you can also place bets on games and have the chance of winning huge prizes.</p><p>Planet 7 Casino came into the gaming world around 2009. They are owned and operated by the Ace Revenue Group, which is a subsidiary of Virtual Casino Group (VCG). The VCG owns a lot of online casinos making them one of the biggest players in the online gaming and gambling business, but they also have a bad reputation in the business (we’ll touch this later in this review).</p><p>Planet 7 Casino can be found at https://www.planet7casino.com. The website is available only in English Language; it is pretty standard with a sleek red and black colour scheme, and navigation within it is easy.</p><h3><em>Getting started with Planet 7</em></h3><p>As long as you’re at least 21 years old, and you are not in any of the restricted countries/ regions (we’ll treat this in detail later in the review), you can signup to begin playing in the Planet 7 Casino. Signing up is a simple process that involves keying your information into the text fields requiring them.</p><p>When signing up, you might have to send a copy of your ID and a utility bill for establishing your address. Though, you can get started and start playing games and betting without sending this documents, you’ll have to send them to receive payment when you witdraw. So it’s better to get all documentation done and dusted from the onset.</p><h3>Is Planet 7 Casino legit or scam?</h3><p>Planet 7 Casino is legit, not a scam. First, this section will answer whether Planet 7 is legit or a scam. You will be sending your money to a company, and you’ll need the money to be available when you want to use it to play games. If you have winnings, you’ll also need to be able to withdraw it.</p><p>Secondly, we will examine if Planet 7 is safe. You’ll be sending sensitive information, and you’ll not want this information to fall into the wrong hands (read: hackers).</p><p>Considering whether a casino is legitimate and safe is important when deciding on a casino.</p><p>Visit the Planet 7 Casino <strong>HERE</strong></p><h3><em>Gaming License</em></h3><p>One of the first test in determining a casino’s legitimacy is looking out for gaming licenses from recognized jurisdictions. A valid gaming license means the company is legitimate, and the jurisdiction it is obtained tells if the company is properly regulated. You’re better served by a company operating under a clear regulatory framework; and if things go wrong, you’ll be better protected.</p><p>In this regard, Planet 7 is licensed to conduct gaming operations through the jurisdiction of Costa Rica. While any business that has a valid license should automatically be considered legit, gambling licensing in Costa Rica does not breed much confidence.</p><p>Costa Rica has no gambling laws that set strict requirements for casino owners; instead casinos are allowed to develop freely and independently. For example, there are no strict requirements in respect of online casino software; and casinos can operate without audits as well as accounting and financial reports. For these reasons and more, Costa Rica is widely considered as an unsupervised and unregulated environment.</p><p>Many casinos apply for and obtain licenses from different renowned jurisdictions. It is telling that Planet 7 Casino has refused to obtain multiple licenses from many such regulated locations, but has instead stuck with the singular license from a jurisdiction free from any testing and regulation conducted by any gambling regulatory authorities.</p><p>To answer the question whether Planet 7 is legit; yes, because they have a valid license to operate. But… their licensing jurisdiction ensures that there’s little to no regulation. To many players, this is a deal breaker.</p><h3><em>Fairness of the games</em></h3><p>The prospect of winning is what motivates you to place a bet on a casino game. You wouldn’t want to place bets on games where it is impossible to win. One way of determining if a casino’s games are “winable” is by checking whether the games have been certified by reputable third party auditing firms.</p><p>In this regard, all the games offered by Planet 7 Casino are certified by Gaming Laboratories International (GLI).

In an era where cyber criminals and identity thieves are always out there to intercept users information, it is important that the casino you choose have structures to secure the sensitive and personal information that you pass on to them.</p><p>In this regard, Planet 7 Casino uses a 256 bit SSL security certificate to encrypt all data in its systems. <a href='https://coolxfile517.weebly.com/freemacsoft.html' title='Freemacsoft'>Freemacsoft</a>. The 256 bit encryption algorithm is the standard used by banks to secure data online because it is nigh unhackable. This means that, with Planet 7 casino, your information is secured.</p><h2>Games selection and software</h2><h3>Software Providers</h3><p>All their games are provided by RealTime Gaming (RTC) which is regarded as one of the best gaming providers in the market. The games provided Planet 7 Casino include both instant play and download based games.</p><p>The download based version allow players to download the games onto their devices. The instant play version is a web based platform that enables you to load the game through a web browser anytime you want to play. It does not require downloading any software, but you’ll always need internet access and bandwidth for every gaming session.</p><p>It is also important to check if the games offered are compatible with mobile devices. Planet 7 is compatible with Android and iOS platforms. Planet 7 is fully mobile optimized – they have introduced a mobile lobby, which is an upgrade on the Planet 7 mobile site. It gives access to all the important aspects of the Planet 7 casino – you can make a deposit, view your favorite casino games and the last games you played, check out the general menu, and browse Planet 7’s selection of table games, real money slots, and specialty games.</p><h3>Game Selection</h3><p>Games selection is one of the most important aspect of selecting a casino because casino games is one of the major reasons people join internet casinos. To appeal to a wide range of players a good casino would offer a variety of slots which are the most popular games, as well as numerous other alternatives such as table games, scratch cards, video poker, and/or live dealer gaming.</p><p>Planet 7 Casino does not have live dealer games; but has a great selection of other games, and they are always adding new and exciting games for players to choose from. This is one of the reasons they make a good casino. They currently have over 150 games.</p><h3><em>Slots</em></h3><p>Slots are very popular because novices and veterans alike can play them; and Planet 7 Casino offers a variety of slots.</p><p>They have slots jackpots (with the chance to win from $15,063.95 – $115,673.98), bonus round slots (that gives players rewards like free spins and prize multipliers), multiple pay line slots (that give players more chances to win), and 3 reel classic slots (with basic features for beginners to get a feel of the game).</p><p>Slot games on Planet 7 Casino include: Purrfect Pets, Caeser’s Empire, Fucanglong, Achilles, T-rex, Cash Bandits, Popiñata, Sweet 16, and more.</p><h3><em>Table Games</em></h3><p>Table Games are games played on tables – virtual tabes. They are the next popular options after slot machines. Planet 7 has a number of tables games which include the very popular Blackjack. They also have Roulette and Baccarat.</p><h3><em>Video Poker</em></h3><p>Planet 7 Casino also offers a lot of options for video poker fans. You can choose from Aces and Eights, All American, Deuces Wild, Loose Deuces, Jacks or Better, Joker Poker, Sevens Wild and more.</p><h3><em>Progressive Jackpots</em></h3><p>Progressive jackpot games give players the chance to win a lot of money simply by playing their favourite game; as a result players look out for casinos that offer different progressive jackpots. Planet 7 has a host of progressive jackpot games.</p><h3>Bonuses and Promotions</h3><p>When placing bets on casino games, the casino always has the edge. So it is good to choose casinos that give you back some of that edge by giving you bonuses that increases your potential to win.</p><p>This is one area where Planet 7 leads. They offer their players a variety of bonuses which includes: welcome bonus, match bonus, daily bonuses and more.</p><h3><em>Welcome Bonus</em></h3><p>Planet 7 Casino gives a welcome bonus which is 200% of the first deposit. Every new members who sign up for a Planet 7 is entitled to this bonus. To get it, all you need to do is sign up, log into your account, and make your first deposit. You’ll get a code; go to the cashier area where you made your deposit, find and click on “Redeem coupon”, and then enter the code sent to you.</p><h3><em>Match Bonuses</em></h3><p>Planet 7 ensures that not only new players get bonuses. They also offer players bonuses on every deposit they make. This is usually 100%, but can go get to 200% for slots and keno players.</p><h3><em>Other Bonuses</em></h3><p>Planet 7 offers different daily bonuses which allows you to get particular bonuses just by making deposits at a particular day of the week. They also offer special bonuses and free spins on new games to encourage people to play the games.</p><h3><em>Comp Points</em></h3><p>The Planet 7 Casino offers 1 comp point for every $10 wagered on any game; and every 100 comp points can be redeemed for $1. This is an offer that is above industry average for comp points</p><h3><strong>Bonus Wagering Requirement</strong></h3><p>Casino ensure that people do not simply deposit and withdraw their bonuses straight-away by establish wagering requirement. <a href='https://downdup512.weebly.com/vip-deluxe-slots-free-coins.html'>Vip deluxe slots free coins</a>. You need to look out for casinos that offer low wagering requirement so that you can earn the bonus quicker.</p><h3 id='planet-7-casino-online'>Planet 7 Casino Online</h3><p>Planet 7 wagering requirement is a 30X play through of the deposit amount plus the amount of the promotional bonus redeemed. In their words: “<em>For example, should a Player deposit $100 and redeem a 100% bonus that requires 30X playthrough, the Player must wager the amount of their deposit ($100) plus the amount of their bonus ($100) 30X before requesting a cash out. This means that the Player must wager $200 X 30 = $6,000 before requesting a withdrawal from their account</em>“</p><p>This is effectively a 60X rollover requirement for Video Poker or table games. This offer is not good enough – the industry standard is 40x the bonus, or 20x bonus plus deposit.</p><p>If you manage to earn the bonus, Planet 7 also makes it difficult to withdraw it. First, there’s a maximum withdrawal on winnings gotten using bonuses, which is determined by the amount of the deposit. For example, if you deposit $100 and redeem a 10x max cash out coupon. The maximum you are eligible to withdrawal is $1,000 (which is $100 x 10).</p><p>There are many other such requirements that makes it difficult to clear the Planet 7 casino bonuses.</p><h2><strong>Restricted Countries</strong></h2><p>The very first consideration when deciding on a casino should be whether the service allows players from your country and/ or region. This is because almost no casino allows access to every user from any location. Whole countries are restricted, and sometimes specific regions within a country are restricted. Typically, the casino will prevent users from restricted regions from creating accounts. But, it is not wise to use a VPN to beat their geo restriction and create an account. This is because problems would come up later when making deposit, or worst still, when making withdrawals.</p><p>That said, it is a scoring point if a casino supports a high number of countries and restricts only a few. Planet 7 Casino restricts 119 countries/ regions from creating accounts and playing games. You have to carefully go through the list, and if your current location is listed, you’ll have to look at another Casino. But if you push ahead and manage to make deposit, you stand loosing your money, and not being about to clear any winnings.</p><img src='https://www.casinomeister.com/wp-content/uploads/planet7-casino-review-768x437.png' alt='Complaints' title='Complaints'><p>The restricted countries are: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Armenia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belize, Benin, Bhutan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, Congo DR, Costa Rica, Cote D’Ivoire, Cuba, Czech Republic, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, French Guiana, French Polynesia, French Southern Territories, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Gibraltar, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Isle of Man, Israel, Jamaica, Jersey, Jordan, Kenya, North Korea, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Moldova, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nagorno-Karabakh, Nauru, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Papau New Guinea, Philippines, Romania, Rwanda, Samoa, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Swaziland, Syria, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Togo, Turkmenistan, Tuvala, Uganda, USA (Maryland and New York), Venezuela, Western Sahara, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe.</p><h2>Available banking option</h2><p>Banking options is an important consideration when choosing a casino. You need to make sure there is a method supported by the casino which is available to you for use in your territory; and the method also has to be simple so that you can make deposits conveniently. A great casino need to offer a large number of payment options available to people in a lot of territories.</p><h3>Deposit Methods:</h3><p>Planet 7 supports different methods. You can make deposits through bank wires and by popular credit/ debit cards such as Amex, Visa card and Mastercard. If you’ll rather use e-wallets, they support Skroll and Neteller. For the lovers of crypto currencies, Planet 7 accepts bitcoin transactions. However, if you do not want to use any of the online methods; they also allow offline methods including Moneygram and Western Union.</p><p>The only accepted currency is The US dollars ($). The minimum amount that can be deposited is $30, while the maximum is $250 per transaction. Only four deposit transactions are allowed in a day; so the maximum you can deposit in a day is $1000. Apart from the bank wires which will take a couple of days, all deposits are usually instant.</p><h3>Withdrawals Methods</h3><p>If you’ll want to get any money you earn, you’ll see the need to look into the withdrawal options a casino supports. With the Planet 7 Casino, withdrawals are processed via Neteller, bank wire, and bank checks.</p><p>The company says that all eligible withdrawal requests will be approved 7 business days after the request date, and the actual payment will take another 7 to 10 business day after approval.</p><p>Like almost all casinos, Planet 7 has both a minimum and a maximum withdrawal limit. The minimum amount you can withdraw is $100.00, while the maximum is $2,500 per week. This means that if you were to win big, it’ll take a long time of making a lot of withdrawing to get all your money.</p><p>Comparatively, the maximum withdrawal limit is pretty low among casinos; there are casinos that easily doubles the maximum withdrawal limit of Planet 7.</p><h3 id='planet-7-casino-sign-in'>Planet 7 Casino Sign In</h3><p>The low maximum withdrawal limit of Planet 7 could be frustrating. Not only does every withdrawal have to go through the lengthy approval process, you’ll also be charged a processing fee of up to $40.00 for every withdrawal.</p><p>However, it should be noted that if there is one area where Planet 7 has received damning reviews, its in making payments. Though the company advertises fast payment processing, forums are replete with players who were not paid either at all or in time. In fairness, the cases are more of not being paid in time than of not being paid at all. Many players complained about having to wait for months (sometime more than 3 months) even when resident in the US and after forwarding the appropriate documentation. Many times, Planet 7 would only wedge in and facilitate payment when the matter is escalated to the public spheres; this is evidently to avoid bad press.</p><p>Infact, because of this bad reputation, the casino is blacklisted by many casino rating forums and has a lot of “Not recommended” status.</p><h2>Customer support</h2><p>It is not a question of whether you’ll have a question or an issue when using a casino, its a question of when. It’s inevitable. I’ll bet that when you submit your queries, you wouldn’t want to be totally neglected or to be given half baked responses that do not satisfactorily address your question/ issue. Therefore customer support is an important consideration when deciding on a casino.</p><p>Planet 7 says that their support service is 24/ 7, available any day and at any time (day or night) to answer and resolve any question or concerns ASAP. I’ll examine the channels that Planet 7 casino offers for contacting them, as well as the quality and timeliness of the feedback from these channels.</p><h3><em>Support Channels</em></h3><h3 id='planet-7-coupon-codes'>Planet 7 Coupon Codes</h3><p>Planet 7 offers a live chat that would privide instant feedback; but this support channel is only available to account holders because you’ll have to log in to make use of it.</p><p><a href='https://coolrload593.weebly.com/free-house-of-fun.html'>Free house of fun</a>. They also have an online ticket system which can be used by all. The online form can easily be accessed on the ladding page of their website; and be used to submit any question or concern. <a href='https://heresfiles940.weebly.com/weather-guru-2-1-accurate-weather-forecasts-10.html' title='Weather guru 2 1 – accurate weather forecasts 10'>Weather guru 2 1 – accurate weather forecasts 10</a>.</p><p>Alternatively, you can contact them through email via help@planet7casino.com. Customers who fall into the VIP category are provided a special email for contacting the service (planet7@viphelpmanager.com).</p><h3 id='planet-7-casino-complaints'>Planet 7 Casino Complaints</h3><p>Lastly, they offer 24/ 7 phone support to people resident in the US with the US toll free line: 1- 888-402-2065. VIP customers also have a special toll free line: 1-855-648-3030.</p><h3><em>Effectiveness of Support</em></h3><p>The one area where the Planet 7 Casino has received the most favourable reviews is customer service. Planet 7 respond promptly to all customer queries, and their response are usually specific and helpful.</p><p>Not all will agree with the helpful part; especially not the many disgruntled customers who had to wait for almost eternity to get paid, and the others who are still waiting to be paid. However, even these category of persons agree to always getting responses every time they contact the Casino’s customer suppot team. The support team almost always professionally try to help – by walking the customer through preparing and submitting the necessary documentation, and promising to escalate the matter to the accounts department.</p><p>The very few reports about Planet 7 support team not being helpful gas to do with slow payment. Technically, that’s a failing of the casino’s account department, and not their customer support department. I’ll even argue that it is the good work of the casino’s customer service that has managed to prevent the gross failings of the accounting department from running the casino into the ground.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Planet 7 is a legitimate company with a license to carry out gaming and gambling operations. They use bank-grade encryption to ensure the safety of users information in their systems; and their games are certified “fair” by a trusted gaming and lottery testing company (GLI).</p><p>Planet 7 Casino has a great selection of games (slots, table games, scratch cards, video poker and more) which are provided by one of the biggest gaming providers in the market (RealTime Gaming). They offer a plethora of bonuses that would excite both new and existing players. They support a lot of banking options for making deposits and for receiving payment; and if you have any question or concern, there are different options for reaching a very professional support group for prompt assistance.</p><p>All these should make Planet 7 a good casino. However, there are few things that count against the Planet 7 Casino.</p><h3 id='planet-7-casino-complaints'>Planet 7 Casino Complaints</h3><p>Their license of operation was obtained in Costa Rica, which means the company is not operating under any serious regulatory framework. Also, their bonus wagering requirement means that their huge bonuses cannot be easily cleared.</p><p>Visit the Planet 7 Casino <strong>HERE</strong></p><p>Lastly, and worst of all, Planet 7 has a checkered history when it comes to paying winnings. There are too many reports of slow payments (taking more than 3 months), and some few ones of no-payments.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="bar-navigation-block"><div class="lg-nav-list"><div class="lg-nav-list-content">&lArr; &lArr; <a href="/play-real-pokies-online.html">Play Real Pokies Online</a></div></div><div class="bar-navigation-block">&rArr; &rArr; <a href="/roulette-line-bet.html">Roulette Line Bet</a></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="post-aside-block layout-new-secondary article-new-page layout-layer-primary secondary-col-layer"><div class="extra-aside aside-clear-entry"><div class="site-lg-container"><aside id="sm-site-aside" class="panel-post-secondary panel-md-col singular-container-layout new-site"><form role="search" method="get" class="panel-site-box" action="#"><label><span class="area-fix-new">Search for:</span><input type="search" class="panel-aside-sm" placeholder="Search &hellip;" value="" name="s"></label><input type="submit" class="secondary-body-node" value="Search"></form></aside><aside id="row-single-node"><div class="content-body"><div class="site-label-extra alt fix block-label-area">Related Posts</div></div><ul><li><a href='/how-to-play-jaxs.html'>How To Play Jaxs</a></li><li><a href='/is-lucky-dice-game-legit.html'>Is Lucky Dice Game Legit</a></li><li><a href='/pink-elephant-game.html'>Pink Elephant Game</a></li><li><a href='/legal-age-for-gambling-in-vegas.html'>Legal Age For Gambling In Vegas</a></li><li><a href='/how-do-you-play-casino.html'>How Do You Play Casino</a></li><li><a href='/why-is-revlo-shutting-down.html'>Why Is Revlo Shutting Down</a></li><li><a href='/doubledown-active-promo-codes.html'>Doubledown Active Promo Codes</a></li><li><a href='/best-casino-on-line.html'>Best Casino On Line</a></li></ul></aside></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer><div class="content-node"><div class="secondary-site-row"><div class="site-lg-container"><div class="article-row-default"><div class="site-lg-container"><div class="site-default-article bar-navigation-secondary nav-static-sm entry-post-sm"><div class="bar-sm-list"></div></div><div class="main-default-layer node-new-block site-default-article entry-post-sm">&copy;&nbsp;2021&nbsp;Casino ANT                       </div></div></div></div></div></div></footer><a href="#" class="aside-article-clear"><i class="container-box-singular entry-fix-layer"></i></a></body></html>
