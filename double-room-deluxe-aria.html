We where directed to a friendly lady at about mid twenty’s. We knew getting a complementary upgrade at the aria was not easy but tried it anyway. Put my ID cc and $20 on the counter. Started a friendly chat and asked if there where any complementary upgrades available. She said because it was busy there was non, but there was a paid upgrade possible from the deluxe king room we had to a Corner Suite withPanoramic View. Normally this upgrade would be a 175 a night extra, but she could offer it to us for 90 a night. We hesitated a bit and she asked us if she needed to try to get some more discount. Sure, we said and she went away to talk to a manager. After a few minutes she came back and said for a 70 extra a night we could have the room, but had to wait a little before the room was ready. This was ok by us. She took the 20 and directed us to a private lounge for suites and above with a separate check in, and complementary coffee, tea and some other drinks and light snacks. After about half an hour the suite was ready and it was really worth the extra bucks. What a nice room! A Panoramic view when you sit in your bubble bad at night drinking a beer and overlooking Las Vegas is priceless. Glad we did the extra investment. </p><div>Thanks for letting us know the epicnes!</div><div>04/13/2019</div><div><span><strong>Tipped:</strong> $20 </span><span><strong>Upgraded to</strong> Deluxe Room <strong>from</strong> Deluxe Room </span></div><p>Arrived on Friday at noon.

She said NO. </p><div>Thanks for letting us know the epicnes!</div><div>01/22/2019</div><div><span><strong>Saved:</strong> $? </span><span><strong>Tipped:</strong> $0 </span><span><strong>Upgraded to</strong> Tower Suite <strong>from</strong> Deluxe Room </span></div><p>I booked regular Deluxe King Room. As I was staying with my brother, I asked at the reception if it would be possible to get Queen instead of King. Clerk started calling somewhere, took him like 5 minutes. In between he asked if we were staying just one night. We confirmed that. From there it was little confusing, as he said that he was able to get us one of Sky Suites. We went to seperate elevators where in a part where the Sky Suites are located, our room was on floor 54. Even though on the key cards, door of the room and accessories in the room (such as toileteries, note pads, pens etc.) it said Sky Suites, the room was just a little bit bigger than regular Deluxe Room, but was decorated as Sky Suite. Also had a nice strip view. I was trying to find the room online but they aren’T offering it there. <a href='https://hereffile798.weebly.com/itools-pro-1-6-9-download-free.html'>Itools pro 1 6 9 download free</a>.

Overall I am a pretty straight up guy. I was in the line and was greeted by a young man who was in his mid 20’s. I gave him my passport and credit card, however at the same time I put a $100.00 bill on the counter and advised him up front that if he can give me a comp upgrade to a corner suite this will be for him. His eyes lit up and he said let me see what I can do for you. He check with his manager and came back to me 5 mins later and told me that my corner suite was ready but I would have to pay 100 bucks per night. I told him that I was not looking for that. He advised me that he can only give me the standard size room but he can give me a 50th floor with a view that was the opposite end of the stripe, plus another $75.00 resort credit. I told him straight up that I would still take care of him but not for $100.00. In the end I took his offer and tipped him $30.00 instead. </p><div>Thanks for letting us know the epicnes!</div><div>12/17/2018</div><div><span><strong>Tipped:</strong> $50 </span><span><strong>Upgraded to</strong> Deluxe Room <strong>from</strong> Deluxe Room </span></div><p>I checked in around 11:30a at the priority desk because I had platinum status. He asked me if I was interested in an upgraded. I said yes and asked if their was any suites available, while I presented him with my ID, cc &amp; &amp; $50 sandwich in between. </p><p>Note I did my homework. I checked online the night before to see what was still available. Every level of rooms were still available. </p><p>So the desk clerk played around with his key board for a few minutes after he said I need to check with a manager.

So I was given the worst possible room. The six floor with a view of the casino’s A/C system. So I believe the original offer of an upgrade was a sales pitch.
