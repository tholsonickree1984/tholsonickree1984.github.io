This is not subject to any deposit, so it’s essentially a free-play bonus that’s subject to a maximum betting stake of £5.</p><p>Once you’ve opened a Royal Panda account and credited it with a minimum of £10, you’ll also qualify for the second part of the <strong>Royal Panda welcome bonus</strong>. This consists of a 100% deposit match up to the value of £100, with a £10 credit equating to a total bonus of £20.</p><p>Conversely, players who deposit £100 into their account will receive £200 with which to play, with these funds eligible to be used across all online casino games.</p><p>You will need to opt-in to this bonus when crediting your account, however, so be sure to tick the box that says you’re happy to participate.</p><h3>Are There Any Other Promotions Available?</h3><p>Despite delivering one of the most competitive welcome bonuses on the market, Royal Panda has not rested on its laurels as a casino operator. As a result, there’s a large number of additional promotions available to casino players, including one that’s set to shower free spins on slots enthusiasts throughout the whole of 2019.</p><p>In fact, players can earn up to 600 free spins with Royal Panda’s Microgaming takeover, which will deliver 20 complimentary free spins every day during April.</p><p>This is dependent on players making a minimum £25 deposit every single day, while these can be deployed across a select number of slots (including Shogun of Time, Wicked Tales: Dark Red, Book of Oz and Fortunium).</p><p>As an existing player, you can also cash in with a casino exclusive weekly Bamboo Bonus, which is available every Friday and provides a deposit match of 50% up to the value of £150. This depends on a minimum deposit of £10, while a wagering requirement of 35-times will be applied to any winnings.</p><h3>What Are The Terms And Conditions Of The Welcome Bonus?</h3><p>The concept of casino wagering requirements is an interesting one, as this also applies to the RoyalPanda welcome bonus. In the case of the deposit match offer, there are also wagering requirements of 35-times the value of the bonus, which means that players who credit their account with £10 and receive £20 will have to bet £700 before they can withdraw any winnings.</p><p>In contrast, the casino free spins segment of the welcome offer carries a wagering requirement of 35-times any winnings that are earned from the bonus. Typical game weightings also apply here, with just of 10% stakes on table games, video poker and live gaming counting towards meeting the wagering requirements.</p><p>Both of these bonus offers are also subject to a maximum £5 wager on any single round of play, while the value of each free spin cannot exceed £0.10. These bonuses are both cashable too, although players who cash out their funds before the wagering requirements have been met with forfeit any winnings.</p><p>The good news is that there’s no limit on how much can be won through your 10 free spins, with Royal Panda happy to cap the maximum stake value instead. This means that the free-play bonus could be particularly rewarding, and it’s certainly one of the most competitive no-deposit promotions on offer at present.</p><h3>What Games Are Available To Players?</h3><p>As if the Royal Panda welcome bonus was not enough, the operator also boasts a games’ library that includes more than 600 titles. More than 500 of these are slot games, with 25 of these titles offering progressive jackpot prizes that often reach eight figures.</p><p>This includes RoyalPanda’s Mega Moolah slot, which regularly makes players millionaires and saw a British soldier claim a staggering £13.2 million payout as recently as October 2015. You can also play high-stakes slots like Hall of Gods and Mega fortune at Royal Panda, making the casino extremely popular amongst high-rollers.</p><p>While the RoyalPanda casino may be dominated by slots, however, it’s also home to a relatively high number of table games. In fact, it boasts 44 different blackjack iterations, along with 22 versions of American and European roulette. There are 14 additional table games on offer too, including baccarat, Caribbean Stud Poker and the iconic Punto Banco.</p><p>Fans of video poker can also sit back and enjoy up to 12 different titles, along with four scratch cards and eight immersive arcade games. The presence of the latter games affords Royal Panda rave reviews, as so many operators eschew this type of title in the digital age.</p><p>The Royal Panda live casino is also one of the best and most authentic on offer, with this platform powered by Evolution Gaming (who won the EGR live casino supplier of the year award for the ninth consecutive time in 2018). Players can access high-stakes versions of live online blackjack, baccarat and roulette through this platform, along with the popular Casino Hold ‘em and Three Card Poker.</p><h3>Is There A Mobile Version Of The Casino?</h3><h3 id='panda-casino-game'>Panda Casino Game</h3><p>One of the most unusual things about the Royal Panda mobile casino is that it’s not available through a native app in the UK, either on iOS or Android platforms. Not only this, but there’s an obvious paucity of blackjack and roulette iterations available to mobile players, and this is something that may discourage many.</p><p>However, there are around 230 games available through Safari and Chrome mobile browsers, with the RoyalPanda website responsive and capable of adapting intuitively to different screen sizes. The vast majority of these games are slots provided by NetEnt and Microgaming, including popular hits such as Dead or Alive, Jimi Hendrix and the aforementioned Mega Moolah.</p><p>The mobile games’ library also includes a select range of special NetEnt touch games, which have been optimised for use on smartphones and tablets. The Starburst touch game is especially popular, as it retains the slot’s classic features and high quality graphics whilst introducing fingertip controls for a more immersive mobile experience.</p><p>This adds a unique dimension to Royal Panda’s mobile casino platform, as does the quality and depth of the site’s live gaming options. In fact, Royal Panda offers nearly all of its available live tables to players who like to wager whilst on the go, with Evolution Gaming once again powering this channel.</p><p><em>“I love Royal panda!! The game collection is wide and it has got very less technical issues compared to others. The most awesome part is the speed of verification and withdrawal speed is simply mind blowing”.</em></p><img src='https://funkypotato.com/images/2013/09/ben-10-boxing-revenge.jpg' alt='Casino' title='Casino'><h2>What Payment Options And Currencies Are Available?</h2><p>Your customer journey with an online casino operator starts when you register and make an initial deposit.</p><p>It’s therefore imperative that new casinos offer a diverse range of payment options and currencies to players, as this makes its verticals more accessible in a number of different jurisdictions.</p><p>But how does RoyalPanda stack up in comparison with its rivals, and does it offer a viable range of payment options to customers?</p><h3>What’s The Maximum Withdrawal?</h3><p>Like the vast majority of iGaming operators, Royal Panda have introduced a daily withdrawal limit that all players must adhere too. However, this threshold is set relatively high at £50,000 per 24-hour period, providing a significant incentive for high-rollers and players with particularly large bankrolls.</p><p>This operator also allows players to withdraw funds using a number of different payment methods, including bank wire transfer. This will take between one and five working days to complete, although this typically takes three days on average with Royal Panda.</p><p>You can also complete withdrawals using debit can credit cards, including Visa, Visa Electron and MasterCard. These transactions usually take between two and three days to complete, although we’ve seen debit card withdrawals processed in less than 24 hours for players whose details have already been verified.</p><p>By now, you can see that RoyalPanda’s withdrawals are extremely quick and efficient, and this trend is continued across e-wallet payment solutions. In short, you can complete withdrawals through Neteller and Skrill with this operator, and these transactions will typically be processed in less than an hour.</p><h3>What’s The Minimum Deposit?</h3><h3 id='panda-casino-games'>Panda Casino Games</h3><p>At present, the minimum deposit at Royal Panda is £10, and this applies whether you’re looking to qualify for the welcome bonus or place a standard wager. However, the minimum deposit may vary according to the rules of different promotions, so you should always check the site’s terms and conditions before crediting your account.</p><p>RoyalPanda also offers an incredible range of deposit options, including around 17 e-wallet solutions. So, players can credit their account instantaneously through payment methods such as Neteller, Skrill, Boleto, eKonto, Euteller, FundSend, Trustly, Ukash, ewire and GiroPay, and you can click here to review the full list.</p><p>You can also use debit and credit cards like Visa, Visa Electron and MasterCard to complete a deposit, and once again these transactions will be processed immediately. Players who have attained gold or diamond loyalty levels (we’ll cover this in a little more detailer later on) can also deposit funds quickly using fast or instant bank transfers, which will see your account credited in a matter of hours.</p><p>On a final note, you can also credit your account using the AstroPay Card and the Paysafe Card. Just bear in mind that using the latter method may incur a 3.5% transaction charge, which will require to pay a little more when making an initial deposit.</p><p><em>”What a great site, the service and help is really good. The live dealers are nice and withdrawals are accepted fast, so what’s not to like?”</em></p><h3>What Currencies Can You Use?</h3><p>Despite being a relative newcomer to the iGaming market, the RoyalPanda casino has managed to achieve exponential and international growth over the course of the last four years.</p><p>As a result, players can gamble with a number of different currencies, including standard options such as Euros and British pounds. Also available are New Zealand and U.S. Dollars, Brazilian reals, Indian rupees, Mexican pesos, Polish zlotys and korunas from the Czech Republic.</p><h2>What’s The User Experience Like?</h2><p>Growing at a rapid rate can cause significant challenges for iGaming brands, but Royal Panda has adapted well as it has continued to expand. This has enabled it to continually improve the user experience available to players, with its website now available in eight different languages including English, Portuguese, Spanish, Norwegian, Finnish, German, Japanese and Chinese.</p><p>The available range of betting limits is also indicative of a diverse and inviting casino platform, with the games’ library at Royal Panda offering value to both casual and high-rolling players alike. Slots can be played for anywhere between £0.10 and £200, for example, whilst there are blackjack and roulette iterations that boast maximum limits of £3,000 and a whopping £75,000 respectively.</p><p>The user experience here is also improved considerably by RoyalPanda’s complimentary loyalty program. The “Loyal Panda” initiative essentially awards players points every single time that they play, regardless of whether they win, lose or just about break even. Slot and scratchcards pay one LP point for every £10 wagered, while players can earn a single LP point for every £25 roulette wager.</p><img src='https://www.livedealer.org/dev/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/micorgaming-baccarat-playboy.jpg' alt='Casino' title='Casino'><p>If your prefer table games or video poker, you’ll receive 1 LP point for every £50 wagered with Royal Panda.</p><p>All players are crowned as bronze members when they sign up, whilst those who earn 15,000 LP points will quickly attain silver level. A further 45,000 points will qualify them for gold status, and from here acquiring 120,000 points will deliver coveted diamond membership.</p><h3>What Game Providers Are Here?</h3><p>We touched earlier on the range of games available through RoyalPanda, which provides a significant selection for players to enjoy. These have been designed by around 12 of the market’s leading developers and software houses, including the NetEnt team that powers the casino and provides the vast majority of slot games.</p><p>This number includes several of Royal Panda’s most immersive and iconic slots, including the five-reel, 20-payline title Jack and the Beanstalk. This game delivers an exceptional return-to-player (RTP) rate of 96.3% and some outstanding animations, making it one of the most popular slots amongst casual and novice gamblers alike.</p><p>Microgaming is also well-represented on the site, with an outstanding range of fun and creatively-themed slots such as the popular, five reel and 25-payline title Pistoleras. Other prominent developers include NextGen Gaming, Barcrest Games, Genesis Gaming, Thunderkick and Elk Studios, each of whom contributes heavily to the overall appeal of the RoyalPanda casino.</p><p><a href='https://coolffil795.weebly.com/web-to-markdown.html'>Web to markdown</a>. Then there’s Evolution Gaming, who as we’ve already said are considered to be the best provider of live casino experiences in the iGaming market. By providing interactive dealers and live casino tables that can be accessed directly through a high-quality webcast, this software house has helped RoyalPanda to create one of the best real-time gambling experiences online.</p><h3>How Easy Is The Site To Navigate?</h3><p>Given that players are still unable to access a Royal Panda casino app on either iOS or Android, it stands to reason that the operator’s website should have been built on the principles of responsive design. This means that it’s easy to navigate your way through the site no matter what device you’re using, with both desktop and mobile delivering satisfying user experience.</p><p>While you’re likely to be struck by the visual beauty of the site when you first click through the home page (we’ll have a little more on this later), desktop users will also notice how Royal Panda’s welcome bonus and additional promotions scroll horizontally above the fold for ease of access.</p><p>When you scroll down, you’ll also notice a horizontal sticky menu at the top of the page, which ensures that the login and registration tabs are constantly accessible to players. As you scroll down the home page, you’re also presented with a clean and organised layout, which allows players to browse game genres and search for specific titles within a couple of clicks.</p><p>On the right-hand side of the desktop home page, there’s also direct access to Royal Panda’s customer support team and live chat feature. This section of the page also neatly displays progressive jackpot titles, helping you to identify which games boast the biggest real-time prizes. It’s also worth noting that the casino platform can be accessed quickly from the top left-hand corner of the home page, with this taking less than two seconds to load on average.</p><h3>What’s The Instant Play Feature Like?</h3><p>Just as there’s no mobile apps available through which to access the RoyalPanda casino on your smartphone, players are not able to wager through a downloadable version of the website or its software. This means that it’s only available in an instant play format on desktop and mobile devices, although this arguably guarantees faster download times and optimises your amount of available memory.</p><p>So, to wager at RoyalPanda on your desktop, you’ll simply need a reliable Internet connection and the latest Flash Player version installed and enabled on the device. When it comes to the former, we’d recommend that you use a secure Wi-Fi connection when completing deposits or withdrawals, as this will provide a greater level of encryption for your financial details.</p><p>If you own an iOS device, you’ll need to ensure that you have Flash Player version 21.0 available. If you’re device runs on Windows 10, you should look to download Flash Player version 32.0 onto your desktop, as this should guarantee quicker loading times and a far more seamless user experience.</p><p>If you can’t download the latest version of Flash for any reason, you should still be able to access Royal Panda’s games’ library on version 11.3 or above, but in this instance the loading time for some titles may be a little longer. The speed of your Internet connection will also impact on this, but for the most part Royal Panda’s casino should be accessible on almost all modern devices.</p><h3>What Is The Royal Panda RTP?</h3><p>We’ve already touched on the high RTP rate of NetEnt’s Jack and the Beanstalk game, and this is typical for Royal Panda’s range of video slots. Overall, video slots at Royal Panda deliver a competitive RTP rate of 95.25% and 98.60%, and this compares well with other online casinos in the UK.</p><p>However, <strong>RoyalPanda’s overall RTP rate of 94.77%</strong> does not compare well with competing operators, but fortunately there’s a mitigating reason for this. This average RTP rate, which has been independently reviewed and verified by the market leading testing agency eCOGRA, includes the returns provided by scratchcards and arcade games, which pay out at between 84% and 88.50%.</p><p>Beyond this, Royal Panda’s blackjack iterations boast an average RTP rate of between 98.37% and 99.64%, while the casino’s roulette variations provide returns of between 94.74% and 97.30%. Overall, table games at RoyalPanda pay out at between 97.34% and 99.37%, and this should serve as a considerable incentive for casual players or those with minimal bankrolls.</p><p>Video poker games also offer generous average payouts of between 97.95% and 99.56%, whilst classic slot titles have a slightly lower RTP rate ranging between 95.60% and 97.60%. These numbers are relatively standard in the industry, and overall the Royal Panda casino offers a large range of low variance games and a deceptively good RTP rate.</p><h3>Customer Support With RoyalPanda</h3><p>Royal Panda’s customer support is also exceptional, with various channels available to players and the operator known to deliver outstanding response times. This is particularly true if you contact the brand by email at [email protected], with a customer service operative likely to reply to your query in less than an hour.</p><p>You can also speak to one of the RoyalPanda team by telephone, on 00356 2778 0418. This number is readily available between the hours of 9:00 and 00:30 seven days a week, although you should note that this isn’t a freephone number and all calls will be charged at your standard local rate.</p><p>Then there’s the live chat feature, which can be accessed by clicking through the “I have a question” tab on the right-hand side of the home page. You can then enter your details and launch the “Start Chat” icon, while this window also provides quick access to the sites email and telephone channels (you can even request a call back from a customer service representative).</p><p>You can also access Royal Panda’s list of FAQs through this tab, and this should provide comprehensive answers to commonplace issues surrounding deposits, withdrawals and the management of your account. The operator is also committed to ensuring that you can access customer support at any time whilst browsing the site, with a floating “Help” tab located on the right-hand side of every landing page.</p><h2>Is The Site Secure And Well-Designed?</h2><p>Another key consideration for players is the level of security that underpins and online casino, as this has a significant bearing on the typical user experience. The design of the casino’s website is also important, particularly in terms of engaging players and presenting the games’ library in the best possible way.</p><p>But is Royal Panda a safe and legitimate casino, and what should players expect when browsing the casino platform? Let’s take a look!</p><h3>Is Royal Panda Safe?</h3><p>The short answer to the first part of this question is yes, with the Royal Panda casino protected by advanced SSL technology and 256-bit encryption. This goes above and beyond the existing industry standards, with Royal Panda’s security partners Comodo heavily safeguarding online transactions and sensitive financial data.</p><p>It’s interesting note that Royal Panda have collaborated with both Comodo and eCOGRA to secure their site, creating a platform that’s extremely robust, fair and inherently transparent. So, while the site’s RTP rate has not been publicly audited, it’s games have been certified by eCOGRA to deliver the advertised return to players.</p><p>The site also offers basic deposit limits and activity limitations to players, while self-exclusion is also available to vulnerable gamblers. However, these options are not prominently advertised through the online casino, and Royal Panda could arguably go a little further to promote responsible gambling and safeguard its players effectively.</p><p>However, the operator is affiliated with the industry-renowned GamCare, whilst it has also taken steps to guarantee the safety of minors online. As a result, Royal Panda can be described as a safe and reputable online casino, and one that enables its players to wager with genuine peace of mind.</p><h3>The Site’s Licensing</h3><p>Royal Panda is based in the EU member state of Malta, and as a result it’s primary license is with the Maltese Gaming Authority.</p><p>As a prominent player in the UK market, however, the operator is also licensed to trade by the UK Gambling Commission under the reference number 39221. You can review this license here, along with any other domains and trading names that are associated with the brand.</p><h3>How Does The Site Look?</h3><p>There’s a school of thought which suggests that Royal Panda’s online casino is one of the best looking in the iGaming market. A first glance, it’s certainly hard to dispute this assertion, with the operator’s use of imagery, colour and graphics exceptionally effective.</p><p>The site is set against a contrasting black and red background, creating a bold canvas that allows the accompanying text and images pop. The above-the-fold banner on the home page also features superb graphics, with scrolling images of casino skylines, floral landscapes and poker tables really catching the eye.</p><p>Royal Panda’s choice of colour is also intriguing, with the brand’s classic black and white logo both simplistic and impactful in equal measure. Beneath this, shades of bright red and deep purple combine to create a stunning visual experience, and one that generates feelings of urgency and excitement amongst players.</p><div class='DlCRVA'><iframe width='auto' height='auto' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZKQ5X5d1SA' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>While the Royal Panda casino may not be the only one that has been exceptionally well-designed in the iGaming market, its sophisticated use of colour and stylish aesthetic undoubtedly affords the brand an edge over its rivals. The sleek theme is consistent across all landing pages too, whether you visit the live casino or check out the operator’s latest promotions.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Royal Panda is a relative novice in the world of online casinos, but despite this it has made a considerable impact in the minds of customers since its debut in 2014.</p><p>It has arguably grown at an ever quicker rate since being acquired by Leo Vegas in the autumn of 2017, with the brand’s cuddly mascot and novelty value giving way to a vast range of games, outstanding customer service and a deceptively rewarding RTP rate.</p><p>With a combination of low variance slots and 25 jackpot games, there’s also a diverse range of low and high-variance titles to keep everyone entertained. So, whether you’re a casual looking to start your online casino journey or a competitive player in search of live action, Royal Panda is an operator that can help you to achieve your objectives.</p><p>There are slight negatives, of course, such as the lack of a native mobile app and the failure of the brand to really push its responsible gambling platform. These should not distract from the overall quality of the operator, however, while they’re also things that can easily be improved in the future.</p><p>Royal Panda deserves to be considered as one of the top online casinos in the UK, and one that continues to punch above its weight against more established iGaming rivals.</p><h2>Royal Panda Casino FAQs</h2><h3>Is It Safe To Deposit And Withdraw Funds At Royal Panda?</h3><p>Yes. This casino only uses certified secure servers for processing transactions.</p><h3>Are There Any Transaction Fees At Royal Panda?</h3><p>No. You will never be charged anything.</p><h3>What Happens If I’m Disconnected During Play?</h3><p>Should you be disconnected during play, the round will be resumed the next time you launch the particular game.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="bar-navigation-block"><div class="lg-nav-list"><div class="lg-nav-list-content">&lArr; &lArr; <a href="/craps-table-payout.html">Craps Table Payout</a></div></div><div class="bar-navigation-block">&rArr; &rArr; <a href="/john-daly-2016-earnings.html">John Daly 2016 Earnings</a></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="post-aside-block layout-new-secondary article-new-page layout-layer-primary secondary-col-layer"><div class="extra-aside aside-clear-entry"><div class="site-lg-container"><aside id="sm-site-aside" class="panel-post-secondary panel-md-col singular-container-layout new-site"><form role="search" method="get" class="panel-site-box" action="#"><label><span class="area-fix-new">Search for:</span><input type="search" class="panel-aside-sm" placeholder="Search &hellip;" value="" name="s"></label><input type="submit" class="secondary-body-node" value="Search"></form></aside><aside id="row-single-node"><div class="content-body"><div class="site-label-extra alt fix block-label-area">Related Posts</div></div><ul><li><a href='/how-to-win-spanish-21.html'>How To Win Spanish 21</a></li><li><a href='/magic-star-casino.html'>Magic Star Casino</a></li><li><a href='/nd-casino-bonus-code.html'>Nd Casino Bonus Code</a></li><li><a href='/online-gambling-sa.html'>Online Gambling Sa</a></li><li><a href='/easiest-way-to-win-money-at-casino.html'>Easiest Way To Win Money At Casino</a></li><li><a href='/casino-online-portugal.html'>Casino Online Portugal</a></li><li><a href='/playtika-slotomania-complaints.html'>Playtika Slotomania Complaints</a></li><li><a href='/best-paypal-casino.html'>Best Paypal Casino</a></li></ul></aside></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer><div class="content-node"><div class="secondary-site-row"><div class="site-lg-container"><div class="article-row-default"><div class="site-lg-container"><div class="site-default-article bar-navigation-secondary nav-static-sm entry-post-sm"><div class="bar-sm-list"></div></div><div class="main-default-layer node-new-block site-default-article entry-post-sm">&copy;&nbsp;2021&nbsp;Casino ANT                       </div></div></div></div></div></div></footer><a href="#" class="aside-article-clear"><i class="container-box-singular entry-fix-layer"></i></a></body></html>
