But no slot shines brighter than Megabucks.</p><p>Launched by IGT in the late 1980s, Megabucks continually features the largest progressive jackpot in Las Vegas and beyond. It has paid out a number of record-breaking prizes.</p><p>Millions of people play this game every year for a shot at life-changing money. They essentially look at the Megabucks jackpot like a lottery that they can play over and over.</p><p>However, some of these same gamblers might think twice about playing this slot if they knew about the Megabucks curse. This curse has caused winners to suffer car accidents, loss of loved ones, and even death.</p><p>The good news, though, is that the Megabucks curse is a hoax. I’m going to explain why after covering more on this famed slot machine.</p><h2>The Megabucks Jackpot Is Very Alluring</h2><p><br>Up until the late 1980s, slots jackpots had always been confined to one machine or a bank of local machines. Megabucks became the first wide-area progressive jackpot, meaning it offers the same prize across multiple casinos.</p><p>Each Megabucks game contributes a percentage of its bets towards the jackpot. Wheel of Fortune is the most popular and common of the Megabucks-branded games.</p><p>Players must wager at least $1 to play. However, they need to place the $3 max bet to qualify for the progressive jackpot. The Megabucks jackpot starts at $10 million and increases from here. The $10 million starting value provides the motivation to risk $3 per spin for this payout.</p><p>Anybody who wins the top prize can take a lumpsum payment worth half the jackpot. Or, they can accept monthly payments for 25 years to get the full value. </p><img src='https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/megabucks-ticket-1547762696.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*' alt='What' title='What'><h2>What Is the Megabucks Curse?</h2><p>The Megabucks curse refers to the bad fortune that strikes jackpot winners. As legend goes, those who are lucky enough to win this jackpot aren’t really so lucky in the end.</p><p>One tragedy actually happened and has been verified by news outlets. Others are urban legends that claim winners have died under unpleasant circumstances.</p><p>You may have heard about the curse of lottery winners. In fact, E! ran a series called THS Investigates: Curse of the Lottery.</p><p>The Megabucks curse is essentially the slots version of this subject. This is also fitting when considering that Megabucks has delivered some lottery-sized jackpots.</p><h2>How Did the Megabucks Curse Originate?</h2><h3>$35m Winner Paralyzed in Car Accident</h3><p>Cynthia Jay-Brennan is the original inspiration for this curse. She was befallen by tragedy at multiple angles after winning big through Megabucks.</p><p>At first, her story seemed like a fairytale. The 37-year-old cocktail waitress was playing Megabucks at the Desert Inn Casino.</p><div><span>She eventually won a $34.9 million jackpot and became the subject of many Vegas-area news stories. At the time, her slots payout was the largest in history.<br></span></div><p>But just six weeks after collecting the jackpot, Jay-Brennan and her sister were involved in a horrific automobile accident. A drunk driver rear-ended them while they were stopped at a red light.</p><p>Jay-Brennan’s sister died shortly after the accident. Cynthia, meanwhile, was left a quadriplegic for the rest of her life.</p><p>Clark Morse was the driver. The 58-year-old had already been convicted of drunk driving five times and finally killed somebody on this occasion.</p><p>He’d been drinking at two bars the night of the accident. The drunken Morse slammed into Jay-Brennan’s car with such velocity that he caused injuries to multiple people in other cars, too.</p><p>Morse fled the scene of the accident and went to his mother’s home. Police were able to identify him via eyewitness accounts and later arrested him.</p><p>Luckily, Morse was finally put behind bars for years. But this fact was of little solace to Cynthia Jay-Brennan, who both lost her sister and the ability to move her limbs.</p><h3>The Biggest Jackpot Winner in History Was Allegedly Killed by Gang Members</h3><p>In 2003, an anonymous software engineer from LA won a $39.7 million payout through Megabucks. The 25-year-old earned what was then and is still the biggest slots jackpot in history.</p><p>As legend goes, he died just days after the win. A number of theories have been floated about how he passed away:</p><ul><li>Died in an airplane crash</li><li>Murdered by gang members in LA</li><li>Overdosed on drugs</li></ul><p>No concrete evidence suggests that the winner suffered any of these fates. He still remains anonymous to this day.</p><p>IGT also actually responded to inquiries about the young man’s fate. They stated that none of the aforementioned scenarios happened and the man is still alive.</p><p>Nevertheless, each of these rumors were regarded as truths among Las Vegas locals at one time or another. Obviously, the rumors can’t all be true unless the man has Lazarus-like qualities and kept rising from the dead each time.</p><h2>Why the Megabucks Curse Is Complete Fiction</h2><p>Cynthia Jay-Brennan’s fate is definitely a tragic accident. However, it’s nothing more than a coincidence, not a curse.</p><p>Jay-Brennan and her sister just happened to be the unfortunate souls who were sitting at the red light when Clark Morse plowed through. </p><p>No mystical, anti-gambling power made Morse get drunk and hit Jay-Brennan’s car. He was a lifelong alcoholic who’d been arrested and convicted of drunk driving many times before. The justice system brought upon the curse in this case. They should’ve locked Morse up for years before this incident and permanently revoked his license.</p><p>The man who won $39.7 million likely became the subject of rumors because he won his jackpot just three years after Jay-Brennan. Vegas locals likely believed that bad fate would strike a lucky winner yet again.</p><p>Only IGT knows the man’s identity. They felt compelled to squash the rumors by stating that he’s indeed alive.</p><p>Furthermore, the winner remains anonymous to this day. Nobody outside of IGT has any real clue what became of him.</p><p>Only Cynthia Jay-Brennan’s story is confirmed true. Anything else regarding the software engineer or other winners is fiction until proven otherwise.</p><h2>You Can Chase Big Slots Jackpots With Little Fear</h2><p><br>Megabucks curse tales will continue to filter through Las Vegas as long as this jackpot remains popular. Considering that it’s still seeded at $10 million, both the jackpot and the stories will persist for years to come.</p><p>It’s anybody’s guess as to what compels Vegas residents to circulate these tales. Perhaps those telling the stories just want to feel better about not winning the big one themselves.</p><p>Of course, urban legends have always been popular. Therefore, locals could simply revel in telling stories of jackpot destruction.</p><p>Whatever the case, you can chase the Megabucks jackpot and other huge prizes without worry. No curse will befall you in the aftermath.</p><p>If you do win, though, you should consider doing everything possible to remain anonymous. A number of lottery winner horror stories suggest that this is the only way to go after big wins.</p><p>Otherwise, third cousins and “neighbors” who live three blocks away will hound you for money. In the worse scenario, you could be murdered over money.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The Megabucks curse dates back to 2000. Megabucks winner Cynthia Jay-Brennan went from joy to misery after being involved in a terrible accident.</p><p>The now-paralyzed woman sparked a curse that extended to another winner in 2003. An LA software engineer supposedly died shortly after collecting a record-breaking $39.7 million jackpot.</p><p>Although still anonymous, he’s the subject of multiple urban legends. He allegedly died through gang violence, an airplane crash, or an overdose.</p><p>The ambiguity surrounding this man’s fate tells you everything that you must know about the Megabucks curse—it’s false!</p><p>No voodoo hex is put on winners of Megabucks nor any other jackpot. Anybody who suffers tragedy after winning is either the victim of an unfortunate circumstance or their own doing.</p><p>Jay-Brennan falls into the former category. However, both lottery and jackpot winners have caused their own demise through foolish and decisions. You don’t need to avoid chasing the biggest progressive jackpots just because of an alleged curse. An unknown force won’t bring bad luck upon you if you win.</p><p>However, you should focus on making good decisions in the aftermath.

Developed by IGT, this highly popular brand of progressive slot machines has been delivering multimillion-dollar fortunes since the mid-1980s.</p><p>Megabucks not only reigns supreme in Vegas, but it also holds the record for the largest slots jackpot ever. In 2003, it paid $39.7 million to an anonymous many from L.A.</p><p>Assuming you play online slots, you may wonder if any internet jackpots come close to offering what Megabucks does. That said, I’ll discuss more on Megabucks along with five online jackpots that may or may not compete with it.</p><h2>What Is Megabucks?</h2><p>Megabucks is a series of progressive slot machines that launched in 1986. Its “wide-area” jackpot network spreads over 700 machines across more than 100 Vegas casinos.</p><p>Many gamblers mistakenly believe that Megabucks is a single type of slot. However, the name merely denotes a brand of progressive slots that are connected to the same jackpot. Various Wheel of Fortune slots are the most-common games associated with Megabucks.</p><p>You can play this game for a single $1 coin. However, you must wager all three coins ($3) to play for the progressive jackpot.</p><p>Speaking of which, the progressive jackpot begins at $10 million. It takes small percentages of each bet to continue growing.</p><h2 id='what-is-megabucks-up-tournament'>What Is Megabucks Up Tournament</h2><p>You must land MEGABUCKS symbols on each reel to win the jackpot. The odds of accomplishing this feat are said to be anywhere from 1 in 17 million to 1 in 50 million.</p><h2>How Much Is the Megabucks Jackpot Usually Worth?</h2><p>The Megabucks jackpot begins at $10 million—immediately making it bigger than any other slots jackpot at the current time.</p><p>No limit exists on how large this prize can grow. However, the Megabucks jackpot typically hits somewhere in the $15 million to $25 million range.</p><p>IGT pays jackpots either in lump-sum value or through a 25-year annuity. You must take a discount when asking for the lump sum, much like with lottery prizes.</p><h2>Where Can You Play Megabucks Slot Machines?</h2><p>IGT offers Megabucks-branded games in other parts of the United States. For example, you can find these slot machines in California, Mississippi, and New Jersey.</p><p>However, the biggest Megabucks jackpot is only offered in Las Vegas and other Nevada gambling locations. The jackpots featured elsewhere don’t have any bearing on those found in Vegas.</p><p>You won’t find the Vegas-based Megabucks at online casinos either. Therefore, you must visit the Silver State to play for this prize.</p><h2>Top Online Slots Jackpots</h2><p>The internet gaming world doesn’t offer any jackpots that completely match Megabucks. However, it does boast several big prizes, including the ones covered below.</p><h3>1 – Mega Moolah</h3><p>Mega Moolah is a five-reel, 25-line slot from Microgaming that revolves around African jungle animals. You qualify for this game’s jackpot by betting just $0.25.</p><p>Launched in 2006, Mega Moolah has paid many of the largest prizes in online slots history. In 2019, it delivered the biggest online slots jackpot in history at €18,915,721 (approx. $21m).</p><p>The jackpot is seeded at $1 million, and it pays through a randomly triggered bonus round. The latter includes a wheel that features four different jackpots and other prizes.</p><p>The “Mega” progressive prize is the largest. Assuming the wheel pointer lands on the Mega jackpot, then you’ll be a millionaire.</p><h3>2 – Mega Fortune</h3><p>Developed by NetEnt, Mega Fortune is a five-reel, 25-line slot that revolves around wealth and extravagant lifestyles.<br>This game quickly became a competitor to Mega Moolah when it launched in 2009. Case in point, it paid a then-record €17,860,868 (approx. $19m) jackpot in 2013.</p><p>Mega Fortune bears obvious similarities to Mega Moolah. First off, you only need to bet $0.25 to play this game and qualify for the top prize.</p><p>Secondly, you can only win the jackpot in a randomly triggered bonus. This round features a concentric wheel with “Mega Jackpot” in the middle.</p><p>You must work your way through three layers of the wheel to have a chance at the top payout. Assuming the pointer lands on Mega Jackpot, then you win.</p><h3>3 – Shopping Spree</h3><p>Shopping Spree is a five-reel, nine-line game from Bovada Casino’s proprietary software. It deals with shopping for extravagant items, such as handbags and diamond necklaces.</p><p>The Shopping Spree jackpot is worth $4.65 million at the time of this writing. You must wager $1.25 per line ($11.25 overall) to qualify for the top payout.</p><p>If you’re keeping track, Shopping Spree forces you to bet almost four times as much as Megabucks to win big. In addition to placing the massive bet, you also need to land five necklaces in a payline to win the top prize.</p><p>This game offers a bonus round that involves selecting handbags to reveal prizes. You must land three dollar signs on the reels to trigger the bonus.</p><h3>4 – Aladdin’s Lamp</h3><h2 id='what-is-megabucks-up-to-play'>What Is Megabucks Up To Play</h2><p>Created by GTECH, Aladdin’s Lamp is a three-reel, three line slot that deals with the common tale of Aladdin. Its jackpot is worth €3.78 million (approx. $4.15m) at the time of this post.<br>Aladdin’s Lamp doesn’t look like the type of game that would offer such a huge prize. Instead, it appears more like a classic slot with slightly upgraded graphics.</p><p>Nevertheless, you can win a multimillion-euro fortune through this game by lining up three Aladdin’s in a payline. The catch: you must wager a whopping €5 per line (€15 total) to qualify for the jackpot.</p><p>As if Shopping Spree’s required bet wasn’t high enough, Aladdin’s Lamp makes you bet five times the Megabucks’ qualifying wager.</p><p>Another downside to Aladdin’s Lamp is that it doesn’t offer any bonuses or special features. In essence, it’s just a basic slot with a huge payout.</p><h3>5 – Jackpot King</h3><p>Much like Megabucks, Jackpot King is a progressive jackpot brand that covers multiple slots. While one of the games is called Jackpot King, other slot machines like Top Cat and Slots o’ Gold also offer the same progressive prize.</p><p>Its top payout is worth £2.62 million (approx. $3.4m) at this time. <a href='https://coolgup732.weebly.com/fontexplorer-x-pro-7-0-09.html'>Fontexplorer x pro 7 0 09</a>. You compete for the jackpot by randomly triggering a bonus in the respective game you’re playing.</p><p>The various five-reel games that host the Jackpot King prize offer decent graphics and reasonable bet sizes.</p><p>You won’t be amazed by the graphics and bonuses available in Blueprint’s Jackpot King series. However, you won’t mind them either, especially when considering the massive potential fortune that awaits. <a href='https://downefil990.weebly.com/iconfly-app-icon-maker-3-9-2.html' title='Iconfly app icon maker 3 9 2'>Iconfly app icon maker 3 9 2</a>.</p><h2>Which Rules: Megabucks or the Biggest Online Jackpots?</h2><p>None of the jackpots covered above match what Megabucks offers on a consistent basis. These games’ top payouts struggle to compare given that Megabucks is seeded at $10 million.</p><p>Mega Moolah offers the next-highest seed value at $1 million. Therefore, these online slots need more time for their jackpots to grow.</p><p>If you want to win the most money possible, then you need to head to Las Vegas and play Megabucks. Alternatively, you can also find some Megabucks games spread throughout Nevada.</p><p>Of course, you may value more than just playing for the biggest-possible jackpot. Bet size and/or features might also interest you.</p><h2 id='what-is-megabucks-up-today'>What Is Megabucks Up Today</h2><p>Again, Megabucks requires a large $3 qualifying bet. Assuming you risk less than this, then you won’t qualify for the progressive prize.</p><h2 id='what-is-megabucks-up-to-in-vegas'>What Is Megabucks Up To In Vegas</h2><p>Mega Moolah, Mega Fortune, and the Jackpot King series give you an opportunity to compete for huge payouts without risking $1 or more. Shopping Spree ($11.25) and Aladdin’s Lamp (€15), on the other hand, should be avoided if you don’t want to bet big.</p><p>As for graphics and features, Mega Moolah, Mega Fortune, Jackpot King, and Shopping Spree all rate moderate to high in these categories. Megabucks, conversely, features an older series of games that greatly resemble slots from the 90s era.</p><p>As you can see, various factors go into deciding whether Megabucks or the biggest online slots jackpots are the most worthwhile.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Megabucks offers a jackpot opportunity that isn’t normally available online. It gives you the ability to win at least $10 million on a consistent basis.</p><p>Online slots, such as Mega Moolah and Mega Fortune, can occasionally reach eight figures. However, they don’t do so all of the time.</p><p>But you should also consider that the same games are cheaper to play. You can enjoy both Mega Fortune and Mega Moolah for just $0.25 per spin.</p><p>In contrast, Megabucks forces you to bet $3 to play. Assuming you’re dealing with a small bankroll, then you might want to stick with internet slots that offer cheap minimum wagers.</p>Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="bar-navigation-block"><div class="lg-nav-list"><div class="lg-nav-list-content">&lArr; &lArr; <a href="/craps-odds-bet-payout.html">Craps Odds Bet Payout</a></div></div><div class="bar-navigation-block">&rArr; &rArr; <a href="/cruises-with-casinos.html">Cruises With Casinos</a></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="post-aside-block layout-new-secondary article-new-page layout-layer-primary secondary-col-layer"><div class="extra-aside aside-clear-entry"><div class="site-lg-container"><aside id="sm-site-aside" class="panel-post-secondary panel-md-col singular-container-layout new-site"><form role="search" method="get" class="panel-site-box" action="#"><label><span class="area-fix-new">Search for:</span><input type="search" class="panel-aside-sm" placeholder="Search &hellip;" value="" name="s"></label><input type="submit" class="secondary-body-node" value="Search"></form></aside><aside id="row-single-node"><div class="content-body"><div class="site-label-extra alt fix block-label-area">Related Posts</div></div><ul><li><a href='/best-casinos-in-united-states.html'>Best Casinos In United States</a></li><li><a href='/lucky-pants-bingo-login.html'>Lucky Pants Bingo Login</a></li><li><a href='/casino-games-pc.html'>Casino Games Pc</a></li><li><a href='/spin-to-win-online.html'>Spin To Win Online</a></li><li><a href='/magic-world-game.html'>Magic World Game</a></li><li><a href='/how-do-you-play-casino.html'>How Do You Play Casino</a></li><li><a href='/why-is-revlo-shutting-down.html'>Why Is Revlo Shutting Down</a></li><li><a href='/midas-touch-game.html'>Midas Touch Game</a></li><li><a href='/popular-dice-games.html'>Popular Dice Games</a></li></ul></aside></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer><div class="content-node"><div class="secondary-site-row"><div class="site-lg-container"><div class="article-row-default"><div class="site-lg-container"><div class="site-default-article bar-navigation-secondary nav-static-sm entry-post-sm"><div class="bar-sm-list"></div></div><div class="main-default-layer node-new-block site-default-article entry-post-sm">&copy;&nbsp;2021&nbsp;Casino ANT                       </div></div></div></div></div></div></footer><a href="#" class="aside-article-clear"><i class="container-box-singular entry-fix-layer"></i></a></body></html>
